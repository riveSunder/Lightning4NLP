    A family are furious after staff refused to allow their soya and dairy intolerant toddler to eat his special packed lunch in the restaurant. Alex and Coral Pouros had spent £30 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot. They had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to dairy and soya, and planned to buy food for themselves from the zoo restaurant. Alex and Coral Pouros (pictured with their son) had spent £30 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot . But they were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead. The family refused and left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and vowed never to return. Osteopath Alex, 32, said: 'We explained the situation and as it was very cold outside I thought he would be understanding. 'I even said that if they had any dairy or soya-free food, we would buy that for Elliott. 'They didn't, but he still insisted he could not eat his lunch in the restaurant. The couple had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to lactose and soya . The couple had planned to buy their own lunch at Wingham Wildlife Park's restaurant (pictured) 'To be honest, we were pretty upset because it seemed totally unreasonable. It's not as if the place was packed because there were plenty of places to sit. 'I wasn't prepared for Elliott to have to eat his lunch outside in the cold and told the owner that we had two choices - either we were allowed to sit indoors or we would have to leave. 'But he wouldn't budge so we left after spending £30 to get in and having a visit that lasted just a couple of hours.' Alex, of Broadstairs, Kent, added: 'It was actually Coral's 32nd birthday and we thought it would be a nice day out, but sadly it wasn't. 'We had been to the park before with a young niece and enjoyed the experience but this time we just felt angry and hurt and certainly won't be going back.' Markus Wilder, curator of the animal collection, disputed the family's claim there was no options for their son at the cafe. 'We have a menu of 55 items and there are only ten of them that contain soya or dairy,' he said. 'Any of our cooked meals he would have been fine to eat; we have jacket potatoes, burgers...' But the family were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead . The family left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and have since vowed never to return . Mr Wilder said the family had been asked to leave the restaurant due to the park's strict policy but claimed they had been offered their own private room instead. 'We're only a fairly small park, and we have fairly limited seating so we have a policy that you cannot eat outside food from outside in the restaurant. It applies across the board. 'The trouble is if we let one person have a packed lunch, then others see it and start to ask why they have been refused. 'It just gets very awkward for us because many people and children have special dietary requirements these days. 'In this case, I spoke to the family and did offer them an empty room nearby where they could still eat indoors, but the mother, in particular, still wasn't happy. 'We also have covered areas outside for people who bring their own food. 'We are looking at expanding the food range to accommodate more needs but our animals must come first and we can't direct funding away from them.'

    Police in the San Francisco Bay area are searching for a 30-year-old physical therapist who was kidnapped on Monday morning and is now being held for a ransom. According to a press conference on Tuesday given by Vallejo police officers, Denise Huskins was forcibly abducted against her will from her boyfriend's home. Her captor or captors also made off with a white Toyota Camry from the home that is registered to her boyfriend. The car was recovered hours afterwards at an undisclosed location miles away from the scene. The car and the home are both registered to Aaron Quinn who neighbors confirmed lives with Huskins in the two-story yellow home on Kirkland Avenue. The Daily Mail Online could not reach him for comment. Police Lt. Kenny Park said that police were first contacted at 1.55pm - hours after her alleged abduction - by her 30-year-old boyfriend who  was in the house at the time of the assault. Park would not comment on why Quinn appeared to wait so long before contacting them and added that the he is not in custody but that he is helping them 'piece the puzzle together.' Scroll down for video . Appeal: Police in Vallejo have asked the public for any help in locating physical therapist Denise Huskins who they believe has been kidnapped and held for ransom. They have issued the picture of her (left) and her Toyota Camry (right) which was recovered away from her home on Monday evening . Arrival: Denise (on the right) moved to Vallejo in June 2014 and began working at Kaiser Hospital and was previously a physical therapist at Southern California Orthopedic Institute . At the press conference Park did not say how the ransom was communicated nor how much is being demanded. Park also said he did not believe the house had been robbed according to the Sacramento Bee. 'We are concerned for Ms. Huskins' well-being,' said Lt. Kenny Park during the afternoon press conference . 'At this moment, Ms. Huskins' whereabouts are unknown and we are treating this matter as a kidnap for ransom,' 'We have dedicated all our resources, and we are giving it full, undivided attention until we can locate Ms. Huskins and secure her safe return.' Search crews and dogs are combing the marsh lands of nearby Mare Island for Huskins. According to family Huskins works at Kaiser Hospital with her boyfriend and her father said he was stunned by the crime. 'This is overwhelming to me,' said Michael Huskins to CBS. 'I don't understand it. That's the hard part. I just don't understand what's going on.' 'If she sees this, I want her to know, that the family is there, we love her and we're not giving up,' he said. Home: Denise Huskins was taken against her will from her home on Kirkland Avenue (pictured) early on Monday morning . Police described her as 5 feet 7 inches tall, 150 pounds, with blond hair and blue eyes. Suspicion had earlier fallen on a local peeping Tom who lived in the area recently, who had been spotted crawling on people's roofs. He has apparently moved away according to neighbors who spoke to ABC News. According to her Facebook page, Huskins works at Kaiser Hospital and Vallejo Police Department has called in help from the FBI and the Solano County Offie of Emergency Services. Officers released pictures of Huskins' boyfriend's car and asked for anyone who may have seen the vehicle during Monday afternoon or evening to contact them. Desperate search: Police would not say what the ransom was for Denise (left and second right with her mother) nor how they knew she had been abducted . Indeed, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, police have been unusually tight lipped about the incident. Once they received the report about the abduction, the alert was not sent over police radio but rather sent by phone between dispatchers and officers. This suggests her kidnapper is listening into police radio broadcasts. Huskins previously worked at a Southern California orthopedic institute and arrived in Vallejo in June 2014. Anyone with information on this case is asked to contact the Vallejo Police Department at 707-648-4524.

    Illegal immigrants are being smuggled out of Britain to avoid deportation – before being sneaked back in after gaining immigration status elsewhere in Europe. Using the ‘asylum loophole’, people smugglers charge £1,000 per person to arrange trips to Europe, allowing illegal immigrants to gain legitimate paperwork. It means that if they are caught trying to return to Britain, they are not sent back to their birth country but to the European state that gave them their first asylum-seeking status. Illegal cargo: The migrants in the Romanian lorry which they boarded in Kent before it headed for Calais via Dover . The lorry was never searched and was said to have breezed through immigration controls in Britain and France . The lorry driver was confronted by reporters from BBC's South East Today programme . The ruse was exposed by the BBC’s South East Today programme which was broadcast last night. Reporters contacted a gang of people smugglers – using a fixer called Ajmal – who agreed to take him out of the country and bring him back for £1,000. Hidden cameras showed Ajmal getting on to a Romanian-based lorry in Kent before it headed for Calais via a Dover ferry. The truck was never searched and was said to have ‘breezed’ through immigration controls in Britain and France. Only hours later, Ajmal was released in Belgium along with 20 other illegal immigrants from India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The report told how many of the illegal immigrants – and some who had outstayed their student visas – were told to make their way to Italy to apply for asylum. Once there they are fingerprinted and are able to gain immigration status, allowing them to lengthen their stay in Europe. If they are caught trying to return to Britain, they only face being returned to Italy or other European countries rather than their countries of origin. Many illegal immigrants were told to make their way to Italy to apply for asylum . John Vine, the former Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, said: ‘I don’t think people realise the extent of the trade of shipping people out of the UK to other parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world' Less than two years ago, border officials spoke of their shock of people trying to smuggle themselves out of the UK . Asked how he would return to Britain, Ajmal said: ‘When I want to go to the UK … he say “ring my same number and I will tell you what to do and where you need to come – I will take you back to the UK”.’ Last night John Vine, the former Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, said: ‘I don’t think people realise the extent of the trade of shipping people out of the UK to other parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world. It is an issue the authorities need to look at very seriously.’ In 2006, Italy announced it would grant citizenship to immigrants who had stayed in the country for five years. However, it emerged that from January to August last year, 140,000 illegal immigrants had entered Europe via Italy. The eight-month figure was more than the entire total for the previous year. Less than two years ago, border officials in the UK told of their ‘shock’ at the ‘very unusual’ case of 28 illegal immigrants trying to smuggle themselves out of Britain. The immigrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka hid on a Polish lorry on a P&O ferry bound for France. They were returned to Dover to be questioned at the Border Force immigration centre.

    (CNN)The sack and pillage of the Mosul museum by the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria displayed a violence rarely seen since the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyian. The bulldozing of the archaeological site of Nimrud marked a new step in the cultural cleansing underway in Iraq. These acts are a deliberate attack against civilians, minorities, heritage sites and traditions. In the minds of terrorists, murder and destruction of culture are inherently linked. It is appalling to see the ravages of this violent extremism in a region that is a cradle of civilization, whose temples, palaces and frescoes have born witness to the glory of Iraq and Mesopotamia for the last 3,000 years. It is important we understand the true nature of this conflict. This war against culture is a war against people. It is part of a strategy to crush free thinking and to ensure domination through oppression. This is why extremists attack schools, media, or other places of culture. Through modern methods of communication and information, they use warped learning and distorted academic texts to hijack young minds. They forbid girls to go to school, kill journalists and vandalize museums: all symbols that embody freedom of thought and respect for cultural diversity. There can be no justification whatsoever for the systematic destruction of the heritage of humanity, and I wholeheartedly support the many religious leaders who have taken such a firm position denouncing these destructions and the perverted use of religion. When culture is under attack, we must respond with more knowledge, and with ever greater effort to work to explain the importance of humanity's shared heritage. This is why we appeal to all cultural institutions, museums, journalists, professors, and scientists to share knowledge widely about the Mesopotamian civilization. We need to remind ‎all of the history of this land which led the Islamic golden age. And we also call on all people everywhere -- and especially youth, in Iraq and elsewhere -- to claim this heritage as their own. Pre-Islamic heritage in Iraq belongs to all Iraqis, just as the Pyramids are written into the identity of all Egyptians. What is happening goes far beyond the domain of archaeologists and discourse on the "irreparable loss of treasures of humanity." What is happening is a security issue. The deliberate destruction of cultural heritage is a war crime. We see how terrorists are using such destruction to destabilize populations, spread terror, and encourage violence. We see also how extremists use heavy military vehicles to transport artifacts from looted‎ sites, and how illicit trafficking is directly funding terrorism. With this in mind, we have joined forces with all partners and neighboring countries to halt these crimes. The acceleration of such violence must be met with an acceleration of global solidarity and action. Faced with such crimes, we hope we can better understand the values we all share, and stand united in respect of humanity.

    The Premier League has been the loudest opponent of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar switching to a winter tournament — staged from November 21 to December 18 — that will be rubber-stamped at the FIFA ExCo meeting in Zurich on Friday. But the richest league in world football is not expected to kick off yet again when the dates become official this week. The PL is resigned to that decision being a formality since the opinions of PL chief executive Richard Scudamore and other European leagues chiefs were virtually ignored at the task force summit in Qatar which recommended a November-December competition. The dates from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar are expected to be confirmed on Friday in Zurich . Qatar will host the 2022 World Cup in the winter despite opposition from Europe's big leagues . Instead, the PL and their European counterparts will be concentrating on winning concessions for such a disruption to their calendar. The biggest confrontation is likely to be with their own UEFA confederation over tightening the Champions League programme. This not only spreads itself over a ridiculous four weeks for their last-16 round but also forbids domestic fixtures taking place on those nights. The PL will also be wanting talks about cutting international friendlies, FA Cup replays and two-legged Football League Cup semi-finals in that season. But more conflict looks inevitable as the FA and Football League will not want their broadcasting deals affected by losing fixtures. However, a December 18 finish would see the Premier League restart on Boxing Day. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore has been among the loudest critics of a winter World Cup . The Global Sporting Director Summit at the Etihad Stadium on April 29 has attracted former England cricket managing director Hugh Morris, who hardly put a foot wrong during his low-profile tenure that included three Ashes victories, as well as Paul Downton, who hasn’t put a foot right since taking charge in January 2014. If the beleaguered Downton were to take any advice from Morris he would surely be told to do his work behind the scenes rather than at centre stage all the time. Hugh Morris (left) and Paul Downton (right) will both be at the Global Sporting Director Summit in April . The Football League are certainly in the right place if they were ever to be worthy of News at Ten attention. Having been evicted by the Premier League, their new offices in London’s Gray’s Inn Road are next door to the ITV news studio in the ITN building. And the complex production role of supplying content from all three lower league divisions in time for the 9pm Channel Five highlights show next season will be handled by ITN. Jason Leonard, RFU president from June, was surrounded by rugby fans on the Twickenham concourse before the Scotland game. It showed rugby definitely got one decision right — fast-tracking Leonard to be president during the World Cup, rather than some anonymous suit. And England Rugby 2015 will be making the most of Leonard being the Twickenham kingpin. Jason Leonard will take up his role as RFU president from June ahead of the Rugby World Cup . Moore’s tweet revenge . Only loveable BBC rugby co-commentator Brian Moore could go on Twitter seemingly to embarrass his own employers. Moore said on air that England scrum-half Ben Youngs was his choice as official BBC man of the match against Scotland. But Moore then went on social media to tell followers: ‘Just to point out I picked (Courtney) Lawes as MoM but Youngs came up and had to deal with it.’ A BBC spokesperson said the right graphic of Youngs was screened and was correctly announced and that Moore stood by his decision. No he didn’t on Twitter. Former Chelsea and Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon is busy advising Premier League promotion hopefuls Middlesbrough, having brought in the club’s first foreign manager Aitor Karanka. He is also running global football funds with super agent Jorge Mendes. Jersey-based Kenyon is also playing an influential role as chairman of burgeoning rugby agency Esportif. UEFA have put out a banal YouTube interview with president Michel Platini answering recorded questions that would have created derision if Sepp Blatter had done it. To Real Madrid legend Iker Casillas’ probing: ‘Mr President, I’d like to ask if you miss playing football?’ Platini replies: ‘Iker, it’s always a pleasure to see you on TV. Normally, when I see you, I give you a cup.’

    Two third grade pupils have been suspended after cracking the school's computer network to find sexually explicit images and sharing them with classmates. A nine-year-old girl, who attends Sunnycrest Elementary School in Lake Stevens, Washington, was using a school computer during class, when she was able to access the porn. She then circulated the images among her classmates before teachers became aware of the situation. The students have been suspended from Sunnycrest Elementary School, pictured, after finding sexually explicit images on a school computer . The incident only emerged when an email was sent to parents promising that a full investigation into the incident would take place. The girl and another student have now been suspended from the school, with Lake Stevens School District promising a probe into how the student was able to find the pictures despite filters being in place. But some parents have reacted angrily after learning their children had seen the explicit images. Austin Maxwell, whose eight-year-old stepdaughter attends the school, told K5 that she was upset after seeing the pictures and that he was shocked a child was able to find such content on a school computers. He said: 'We never in he world would have thought she was accessing what she was accessing on the school's equipment.' The third grade student was said to find the explicit images after circumnavigating the school's computer network which filters adult content . The email sent to parents by district officials said that all student computer use at the school is being suspended until a full investigation takes place. It read: 'Once staff members became aware of the situation, Information Technology technicians were immediately notified and all student computer use at Sunnycrest is suspended until our investigation is complete. 'To ensure that all images have been removed, our technicians have deleted content from all Sunnycrest third-grade students' computer accounts. 'In addition, all students will be once again reminded about digital citizenship and the importance of notifying an adult right away when encountering inappropriate content. '

    Four years after undergoing brain surgery, American JB Holmes has a golden opportunity to put the seal on his heartening recovery by claiming the biggest title of his career on Sunday. The huge-hitting Kentucky native served notice he was bang in form when he opened up the WGC-Cadillac Championship here with a startling round of 62 – described by Johnny Miller on American television on Saturday as one of the great rounds of the last 20 years. It seemed to catch up with Holmes when he put four balls into the water on Friday and started with an ugly three putt from just 5ft at the first hole of his third round. JB Holmes acknowledges the crowd after making a hole-in-one during Saturday's round . Holmes, who leads the WGC-Cadillac Championship by five shots, had brain surgery four years ago . For the first time since Thursday he did not own the lead outright and, with players of the calibre of Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson and Masters champion Bubba Watson lurking, there were fears he would fall back still further. But the 32 year old showed commendable resolve to put that opening hole mistake behind him and play wonderfully patient golf thereafter to finish up with a 70 on Saturday and establish a commanding five shot advantage. With Johnson and Watson his nearest pursuers, Holmes won’t be spending the mammoth £1.25 million first prize just yet. But the manner in which he finished off his round, with four birdies in a row from the 14th hole, augurs well for his chances. Lee Westwood is best placed of the Brits in 8th place but a long way off the pace, at eight shots behind. Rory McIlroy is no fewer than 11 strokes adrift and admitted he had little to play for but a top five finish in the final round. The big-hitting Holmes looks delighted after becoming the second man to ace the 14th in 30 minutes . After a difficult start on Saturday Holmes remained patient to hold onto his lead going into the final round . ‘I felt like I hit it a little better but my iron play is still not as sharp as I would like it to be,’ said the world No 1. An unusually wet and windy third round made it tough for the players, with only Johnson (69) managing to break 70 among the last 12 groups. Yet there were a remarkable number of perfect shots played. Take the par three fourth, a hole so long and difficult there hadn’t been a hole in one there for 26 years. Yet on this day, almost unbelievably, there were two in the space of 30 minutes, as first Johnson holed his tee shot, to be followed by the leader himself shortly afterwards. He might have had an ace but Holmes would get to the 14th without a birdie on his card. At that point, however, he broadened his shoulders and put together his brilliant finish that has left the tournament as one for him to win or lose on Sunday. Dustin Johnson, who is Holmes' closest threat, eyes up a put during Saturday's round . Johnson also aced the 14th, but is five shots behind Holmes, alongsided Masters' champion Bubba Watson . After shooting an 80 in the USPGA Championship in 2011 Holmes withdrew and, suffering from vertigo symptoms, went to see a neurologist. He was eventually diagnosed with structural defects in his cerebellum and underwent two gruelling bouts of surgery. Last May, Holmes confirmed his full recovery with an emotional victory in the Wells Fargo Championship in North Carolina. Now he has the chance to register an even more prestigious victory. The huge advantage this Blue Monster course offers the big hitters was made plain by the identities of the top three. In fact, they might be the three biggest hitters in the modern game. Lee Westwood is the best-placed Brit, but his eight shots back and tied for eighth place after three rounds . Johnson and Watson are showing just why they will be heavily favoured at the Masters next month, when the latter will be trying to win a third green jacket in four years. If he shows the same gossamer touch as he has here, he must have a great chance. He is the only player in the field to break par in every round. Westwood is playing in his 50th WGC event but it is a long shot that it will end in his first victory. Still, he is showing good form as well heading to Augusta. Sergio Garcia stands alongside Westwood, with Irishman Shane Lowry a further shot off the lead. But Welshman Jamie Donaldson, runner-up here last year, fell away following a disappointing round of 76.

    The English don’t actually care much for music,’ said Sir Thomas Beecham, the great 20th-century conductor and noted wit, ‘but they love the sound it makes!’ This week the sound that has filled our concert halls and all the spaces where music-lovers gather has been of loud cheering. When it was announced on Tuesday that Sir Simon Rattle will be coming home from Germany in 2017 to run the London Symphony Orchestra, whoops of delight could be heard all the way from London’s Barbican Centre, where the LSO play, to Menlove Avenue,Woolton, the middle-class suburb of Liverpool where Rattle was born 60 years ago. The most remarkable English classical musician since the celebrated Beecham, Rattle has scaled the highest peaks. Appointed CBE at the ripe old age of 32, he was knighted seven years later, and elected principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, the world’s most formidable orchestra, at 44. Conductor Sir Simon Rattle is to join London Symphony Orchestra as music director . In an age of overpaid footballers and gruesome shows like The X Factor, an age when the mediocre wear garlands tossed by dullards, here is a man who has truly earned his laurel crown. When he received the weighty badge of the Order of Merit last summer (‘Don’t try conducting with this thing on!’ the Queen told him at the investiture) it was formal recognition that he belonged to the best of the best. Now the man who conquered the world is coming home to join our leading orchestra and, what’s more, he sees his role not just as a conductor but as an ambassador, an educator, whose duty is to boost musical talent wherever he can. ‘Frankly,’ he says, ‘what goes on in the primary school is going to be just as important as what goes on in any concert hall.’ Knowing Rattle as I do, this was no throw-away remark. Talk of greatness is usually misplaced. There are never many truly great performers in any field. So when they do come along it is our duty to recognise the special gifts that lift them above the pack. We could call it the Federer distinction. Roger Federer is a great tennis player, perhaps the greatest; Andy Murray is merely very good. In the performing arts it can be difficult to describe what greatness looks like because, unlike in sport, there are no clear winners and losers. Over time, however, you have a sense of those who achieve it. Laurence Olivier, for instance, was a great actor. Rudolf Nureyev was a great dancer. Frank Sinatra was a great singer. And Sir Simon Rattle is unquestionably a great musician. Born on the same road in Liverpool as John Lennon, Rattle was at primary school when The Beatles took off like a rocket. No magical mystery tours for him, though. The Rattler, as he is known, was a bookish child, who played the piano and was later a percussionist in the National Youth Orchestra. ‘I tried to interest him in cricket and football’, said his father Denis, ‘but he always seemed to have his head in a music score.’ Sir Simon (right), whose youngest child with Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kožená (left), 41, is seven months old, has directed the Berlin Philharmonic since 2002 . Denis Rattle, originally from Kent, was a businessman who taught English in his retirement. At Oxford University, where he knew Sir Edward Heath, he had played in a jazz band, so he did nothing to discourage his son’s enthusiasm for music. When Denis and Pauline Rattle took their son to see the comedian Al Read at the Liverpool Empire, the five-year-old stopped the show. So many members of the audience were amused by the sight of a curious little boy leaving his seat to peer into the orchestra pit that Read had to tell him: ‘Come on, lad. I’ve got a show to do!’ The young Rattle never set foot in Liverpool’s football ground Anfield or Everton’s Goodison Park as his father might have wished but he was a regular at the city’s wonderful Philharmonic Hall where, in 1966, his life changed for ever. Gustav Mahler’s mighty Second Symphony, the Resurrection, despite its challenging discords, made him realise even then, aged 11, that he wanted to be a conductor. And now he was determined to learn how. He studied music scores his sister brought home from the library; he pored over composers’ writings on orchestration. He would write down the percussion parts of big orchestral pieces, gather friends and family, and hand out those parts so he could conduct his impromptu orchestra while a record of the music played in the background. When he was 15, he cajoled enough musicians together to form a proper orchestra and stage a charity event at Liverpool’s College Hall. It was a resounding success. Rattle’s days as conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra are the stuff of legend. When he went there aged 25 in 1980 he was, musically speaking, barely out of short pants and the orchestra was at best lacklustre. When he left 18 years later as a knight of the realm, the CBSO was acclaimed as one of the world’s finest orchestras, and had a magnificent new home. Symphony Hall, which opened in June 1991 as a result of Rattle’s persistence and enlightened cross-party political co-operation, remains the best concert hall in Britain. So when people talk about the cultural development of Birmingham, and Rattle’s substantial part in it, they are not fibbing. The question is: what can he do for London and Britain? The signs are promising. There is a clear will to build a concert hall worthy of London’s unrivalled reputation as a city of culture and Rattle knows, for he is no fool, that his appointment can only assist the process. In the City they are no fools either. Everybody understands that, with Rattle at the helm of such a fine orchestra, the LSO could become world-beaters not only in public performances but also in the world of music education. Rattle sees his role not just as a conductor but as an ambassador, an educator, whose duty is to boost musical talent wherever he can . Rattle once described how moving it was to bring deaf children into rehearsals in Birmingham, and see how they responded through vibration alone to the experience of a Beethoven symphony. In Berlin he wasted no time in working with children from the city’s less well-off backgrounds, involving them in dance collaborations with the Berlin Philharmonic. Some musicians, brought up in the old school, were sceptical but not for long. ‘What Simon wants’, musicians used to say, ‘Simon gets’. Which is why his return to London is so thrilling, and so important. In a world of show-offs and halfwits, here is a man with the faith and willpower to move mountains: not on his own behalf but for an art form itself. He believes that great music can transform lives. Describing Leonard Bernstein, the great American conductor and educator, who wrote West Side Story in his spare time, a musician once said: ‘Lenny reminds you why you wanted to become a musician in the first place.’ That is Rattle’s talent too but how he achieves it is hard to pin down. It is the conductor who makes all the difference as to whether a performance sinks or swims. What you see as he steps on to the podium, is the tip of a vast iceberg of activity involving planning, preparing, rehearsing, managing schedules and endless background work to understand the music. This is what helps make Simon Rattle one of the world’s greatest, says his biographer Sir Nicholas Kenyon: ‘He is a meticulous planner, has a fantastic insight for the right combination of pieces in a concert programme and is a brilliant pacer and galvaniser of rehearsals, knowing exactly what he has to achieve and motivating his players accordingly.’ But it still fails to explain his achievements. When his performances take off, musicians and audiences alike would rather be nowhere else. It isn’t so much a matter of his technique with the conductor’s baton, or bringing in the trombones when they’re feeling left out as something undefinable. In 1999, a critic memorably described him on the podium: ‘Sometimes he bent to his knees, puffed his cheeks and mimed a straw-chewing yokel to encourage a proportionate rustic attitude in his players. That was especially during Beethoven’s “Pastoral” Symphony...During the pizzicato interlude in Mahler’s Second Symphony, he dropped his hands to his sides and encouraged his band just to pluck ’n’ swing.’ What audiences see in Rattle is a man who feels that, for as long as he is conducting it, that piece is the most important thing in the world. Musicians, hardly sentimental, are happy to follow him because every concert is an adventure. As Rattle says: ‘Always the journey, never the destination’. His genius, as it always will be with the greats, is that he possesses an alignment of mind and heart that cannot be taught. ‘Simon can achieve things in a performance,’ a Berlin musician said last week, ‘that can never be learnt.’ Now he is coming home for what he calls ‘one last challenge’. To which we can only cry: ‘Hurrah!’

    The board of trustees for University of Oklahoma's Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity has admitted that the racist chant that shocked the nation had been circulating among the brothers for three to four years before it surfaced last weekend on social media. The alumni who oversaw the disgraced chapter of SAE issued a statement on Wednesday calling the song a 'horrible cancer' and apologized for not stamping it out when it emerged years ago. The statement confirms reports that the 'there will never be a n***** SAE' chant heard aboard a chartered fraternity bus last weekend had been passed down between generations of new pledges. The national SAE headquarters has denied that the song is part of the fraternity's tradition, though officials said they are investigating claims of racism at other chapters across the country. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of Oklahoma was closed down on Monday and fraternity members forced to moved out . A popular statue on the OU campus was adorned with a protest from the group that leaked the racist SAE video. The statue 'Sower' had its mouth taped over with the word 'unheard' On Tuesday, the president of the University of Texas announced he had launched an investigation into reports that the song had been used by members of the SAE fraternity there, as well. The trustees also intimated that current and former members of the fraternity were being harassed and threatened and called for 'all parties to begin the healing process.' 'The OU SAE Board of Trustees has discovered that a horrible cancer entered into the OU chapter of SAE three to four years ago and was not immediately and totally stopped,' the statement said. 'It should have been. We are sincerely remorseful for the pain that this terrible chant has caused and would ask for your forgiveness. We are truly sorry.' On Monday, the University of Oklahoma shut down the SAE chapter on its campus and closed down the house. On Tuesday, President David Boren expelled the two students at the center of the racist chant. The video that emerged on social media on Sunday was taken aboard a chartered bus with members of SAE and the sorority Delta Delta Delta. The shocking racist song has been circulating the SAE fraternity at OU for at least three years, trustees said . It included two brothers - 19-year-old Parker Rice and 20-year-old Levi Pettit - leading other fraternity members in singing 'there will never be a n***** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me. There will never be a n***** SAE.' The members of the board of trustees for the fraternity were not identified in the statement.  OU spokesman Corbin Wallace told Daily Mail Online fraternity trustee boards are typically made up of alumni and that they oversee the administration and finances of the fraternity houses. A request for comment from the SAE headquarters in Evanston, Illinois, was not immediately returned. The OU SAE Board of Trustees has discovered that a horrible cancer entered into the OU chapter of SAE three to four years ago and was not immediately and totally stopped. It should have been. We are sincerely remorseful for the pain that this terrible chant has caused and would ask for your forgiveness. We are truly sorry. For the safety of the students that were involved and the students who were not involved, our desire would be for all parties to begin the healing process. We hope that this despicable situation will forever change an atmosphere that would even allow an incident like this to take place.

    (CNN)Let's just say -- hypothetically -- you found yourself in possession of Ecstasy while in Ireland on Tuesday. No worries. Everything was cool, because it wasn't illegal Tuesday. Wednesday could be a different story. An appeals court ruling invalidating one section of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 made the controlled substances it had regulated legal for at least one day. The Independent newspaper of the United Kingdom said Ecstasy, ketamine and magic mushrooms were three of the temporarily legal drugs. The Court of Appeal ruled those drugs and others had unconstitutionally been added to Section 2 of the law. "We prepared for this possibility. Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by Cabinet," Minister for Health Leo Varadkar said in a written statement. The government had to get the new legislation through parliament so the drugs added to the law since 1977 could be considered illegal again. It should happen within 24 hours, the Department of Health said Tuesday. Drugs such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin remained illegal as did the sale of "psychoactive substances." The Independent said past convictions for some drug offenses will be called into question but The Journal of Ireland said the court's decision will impact only cases currently in the judicial process.

    A Good Samaritan van driver is fighting for life in hospital today after being dragged along a motorway by an opportunist thief he had tried to help. The 28-year-old victim stopped his VW Caddy van after seeing a lorry had overturned on the M602 motorway near Salford, Greater Manchester, at 8.30am yesterday. He got out on the hard shoulder - leaving his keys in his ignition - and walked over to see if he could help him. Good Samaritan: The driver stopped to help the driver of this overturned lorry but they then stole his van and dragged him along a motorway leaving him critically ill . Attack: The van driver is in a critical condition after the incident on the M602 motorway near Salford, pictured, . But the lorry driver then jumped in to the man's VW and drove away, prompting the stunned victim to desperately cling on to his van. Greater Manchester Police revealed the van driver is in a 'critical condition' in hospital with severe head injuries after being dragged 'some distance' down the M602 before falling off. Detectives are questioning a 43-year-old man, believed to be the lorry driver, on suspicion of attempted murder. But they are appealing for any eye-witnesses and said the white VW Caddy was driven onto the M60 towards Stockport and remains missing. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: 'At around 8.30am on Sunday March 1  a lorry overturned on the Warrington-bound M602 slip road just outside Salford. 'The 28-year-old victim pulled his VW Caddy van over to the hard shoulder, thinking that he would be able to assist the driver of the lorry. 'He left his keys in the ignition as he went to help, only for the lorry driver to jump into his van and drive off, with the victim still clinging to the vehicle. 'The victim was dragged for some distance along the motorway before he fell off and sustained serious head injuries.' Appeal: Police are yet to find the stolen white VW Caddy, file picture, which has the registration number DY14 FPN .

    Prehistoric hunters may have tipped their stone arrows and spears with poisons to help them bring down prey, scientists believe. Researchers have developed a new technique that allows them to test ancient weapons for residues left by toxic plant material added to them. Preliminary tests have suggested that a set of 4,000-year-old stone-tipped arrows from Egypt were coated with poisonous compounds including the plant Acokanthera. Dr Valentina Borgia, a specialist in paleolithic hunting weapons at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the University of Cambridge, believes hunters may have been using toxic chemicals on their weapons up to 30,000 years ago. The image above shows arrows from China that were used in a crossbow that were dipped in poison . She said that Paleolithic hunters may have used poisonous pastes made from plants to help make their weapons kill prey more swiftly. Early humans may have evolved to throw spears allowing them to hunt around two million years ago, a new study has suggested. Scientists have found that the skeletons of early species of human changed to give them the ability to throw much like modern humans. A study of fossils of Homo erectus, an extinct human ancestor, shows that their shoulders and collar bone would have allowed them to hurl sticks accurately and powerfully. This would have enabled Homo erectus to become a proficient hunter, able to throw weapons like spears and rocks at potential prey. She said: 'It made good sense for people to use poisons. 'On their own, Palaeolithic weapons with stone arrowheads may not have been deadly enough to immobilise or kill a large animal such as a red deer. 'Poisonous plants were plentiful and the prehistoric population knew the environment where they lived, they knew the edible plants and their potential as medicines and poisons. 'To fabricate a poison is easy and economic, and the risk is minimal. In addition, the making of poisons is often part of the tradition and the rituality of hunting.' Dr Borgia has been working with forensic scientist Michell Cralin from Northumbria University and Dr Huw Barton, from the University of Leicester, to test for the presence of poisonous plants on prehistoric weapons. Using a technique called liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, which is used to detect traces of drugs by modern forensic scientists, they are examining residues left on the tips of ancient weapons. They are also looking for the presence of starch grains that may have been left on the weapons from toxic plant material. This wooden spatula from Malaysia wrapped in a palm leaf was used to apply poison to darts used for hunting . Dr Borgia has conducted tests on 4,000 year old arrow heads found in Egypt (left) that are thought to have been tipped with a poisonous black residue. The image on the right shows a pot of curare, a plant-based poison which is still used by some indigenous hunter-gatherers in South America to coat darts and arrows . They can then compare the results from these tests against a database of known poisonous plants. Dr Borgia has already collected samples from a number objects known to have contained poison and ancient weapons to test the technique. These include a 1926 Chinese pot containing Aconite poison inside, Malaysian darts tipped with the poison Upas, Chinese crossbow arrows and a number of African arrows. Many hunter gatherer societies are known to use poisons when they are hunting. The Yanomami people in the Amazon rainforest use curare - a mix of bark scrapings from Strychnos vines - to tip their darts and arrows when hunting. The use of curare was once common among indigenous populations in South America. The researchers have used starch grains like the ones shown on the left from the plant Aconitum napellus  to help identify poisonous materials. Aconitum was found inside this pot on the right thought to date from 1926 . In Africa hunters use another species of Strychnos to produce the poison strychnine, while other plants like Acokanthera, and Strophantus are also used. Hunters in Northern Asia are also known to have used monkshood to kill large animals such as bears and Siberian ibex. The seeds from yew trees are also thought to have been used to poison arrows. Dr Borgia has also collected black residue from six arrows that date from pre-dynasty Egypt. These 4,000-year-old arrows were first studied by scientists 40 years ago when small portons of the residue from the stone tips were injected into a cat. Opium, magic mushrooms and other psychoactive drugs have been used by humans for thousands of years. An anthropologist has discovered that humans have been cultivating and using mood-altering substances since the Stone Age. Professor Elisa Guerra-Doce has compiled evidence from around the world that Neolithic people were taking drugs derived from cacti in 8,600BC and that they were cultivating opium poppies by around 6000BC. Researchers have also found reddish stains on 13,000 year old human teeth found in a burial pit in Duyong Cave on Palawan Island in the southern Philippines, which are thought to be caused by chewing the leaves of the betel plant. It is still chewed through out much of Asia as a mild stimulant. Charred cannabis seeds have also been found in bowls that date from the Bronze age Pit-Grave culture that appeared in Romania around 2000BC. This bone harpoon in a museum in Cambridge carries a warning label that reads 'Care, Has been poisoned' The animal did not die but became ill, suggesting the presence of a poison. Dr Borgia said: 'Nowadays we have the right instruments to get more information without cruelty to animals. 'Initial tests strongly suggest the presence of Acokanthera, a poisonous plant on our database, but we can’t be completely certain as there are a number of components in the compound. 'We know that the Babylonians, Greeks and Romans used plant-based poisons both for hunting animals and in war. 'In fact, the word ‘toxic’ come from toxon, the Greek for bow. Taxus is a genus of the yew tree with a springy timber traditionally used to make bows. 'It also produces seeds used to poison arrows. In Britain, yews grown for their timber were planted in churchyards so that animals wouldn’t be poisoned by eating their berries. “Few hunter-gatherer societies remain today but all the groups that have survived employ poisons.'

    A report has been reportedly been released that hints at a hostile workplace for women in the Victorian Liberal Party. The internal report is believed to show that some women have been asked inappropriate questions about their marital status and had been discouraged from seeking leadership positions.

Victorian Liberal MP Inga Peulich claims she was bullied by members of her own party . Upper House Mary Wooldridge admits that the the party has lost female voters which is perhaps due to the inappropriate treatment of women during the preselection process and also workplace bullying . The internal Liberal Party report apparently found that, during preselection, only female candidates were asked questions about their family and personal life. The report outlines the Liberal Party's unprofessional questions toward women about their personal lives during the preselection process . 'How were they going to balance family and political life?' and 'Who would cook the meals?' were some of the questions asked according to the report. It also mentioned a number of occasions that 'involved party members in limited areas engaging in intimidation, threatening and bullying behaviours towards female party members and members of Parliament,' The Age reported. The report made 14 recommendations, including stepping up general participation of women and increasing the number of females in the party. Upper house Mary Wooldridge reportedly noted that the Liberal party has lost female voters. 'We've gone from a party where women clearly vote for us, to one where they clearly do not,' she said. The internal report also suggested that a women's network be created to boost morale and allow Liberal women to connect to each other and questioned the need for spouses to be included in the preselection process. Opposition leader Matthew Guy (right) has called for more women to join parliament in a bid to modernise . There are currently only six women in the Victorian Parliament's lower house. Opposition leader Matthew Guy has called for more women to join parliament as he believes the party needs to reform in order to win back the government from Labor.

    Despite more than 600 British jihadists having fled for Syria and Iraq, only 25 terror suspects are currently subject to asset-freezing orders. In total, just £61,000 in 59 bank accounts belonging to suspected terrorists has been blocked by the Treasury, a report has found. The report, by the independent reviewer of terror legislation David Anderson QC, showed another 28 people have had their bank accounts in the country frozen under European orders. Scroll down for video . Only 25 terror suspects are currently subject to asset-freezing orders, a report by independent reviewer into terror legislation David Anderson QC (pictured), revealed . It showed there were eight new Treasury designations in the year to September 2014 under the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010 - a sharp decline from 162 in 2008. Mr Anderson concluded the figures for assets frozen were 'remarkably low. He said they indicate asset-freezing has played only a 'marginal role' in combating 'the most serious terrorist threat of the present time'. Sharmeena Begum was revealed as the 15-year-old British schoolgirl who led three others to join ISIS . 'Travel to and from such conflict zones, together with the preparation of terrorist acts, often requires funding and facilitation,' he said. 'There has been an attempt to use asset-freezing legislation to respond to the threat posed by UK residents who travel to and from Syria and Iraq for the purposes of terrorism. 'But bearing in mind that over 600 Britons have travelled out there, the small number of designations indicates that asset-freezing has played only a marginal role in combating the most serious terrorist threat of the present time.' The report will raise serious concerns as increasingly numbers of young homegrown jihadists continue to abandon their homes in favour of Islamic State. It comes as the identity of a 15-year-old London schoolgirl who led her three best friends to Syria after becoming radicalised was revealed. Sharmeena Begum fled Britain to join Islamic State in December - and was the first of four GCSE pupils at the same school to become jihadi brides. She is believed to be in the IS stronghold of Raqqa with Bethnal Green Academy pupils Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, who travelled to Syria last month. Yesterday, video emerged apparently showing the three runaway British schoolgirls in Turkey before they fled into Syria to become brides for Islamic State militants. The footage is believed to have been taken by a foreign spy who was arrested for helping the trio cross the border. The girls are said to have first arrived at Istanbul Ataturk Airport before heading to the southern city of Gaziantep close to the Syrian border. New footage emerged that claims to show three British schoolgirls in Turkey before they fled across the border in Syria to become jihadi brides for ISIS militants . The footage is believed to have been taken by a foreign spy working for the Canadian intelligence service who was arrested on Thursday for helping the trio cross the border . Earlier this week, it emerged the girls had paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family. Police discovered they paid the £1,000 cost of their flights from Gatwick airport to Istanbul in cash. But their families, appearing before the House of Commons home affairs committee, insisted that someone else helped them with the cost of the air tickets as the missing jewellery was not worth £1,000. Halima Khanom, sister of Kadiza Sultana, said: ‘My sister used to borrow a piece of jewellery off my daughters that was very sentimental to her and that’s what she’s taken. Pictured from left, Amira Abase, Shamima Begum and Kadiza Sultana paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family. They are understood to be in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa . ‘I feel there is someone out there helping in terms of funding because there’s no way my sister has got the cash to fund herself.’ At least 22 young women, the majority under the age of 20, are feared to have travelled to Syria from the UK over the past 12 months. Police said the total confirmed number of people travelling to fight is now around 700, with many more suspected of flying out undetected. Islamic State seized large swathes of land across Syria and Iraq last June, including territory close to the Turkish border. Khadiza's cousin Fahmida Aziz (left), Shamima's sister Sahima Begum (centre) and Amira's father Hussen Abase (right), appeared before the House of Commons home affairs committee earlier this week .

    For three long years Claire O’Meara put her regular, excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high-flying career in sports marketing. Long hours spent at her computer, plus business trips abroad were surely responsible for triggering the searing headaches that made it feel as though her head was being gripped in a vice. ‘I was 30 when the migraines began, randomly at first, but then they came every month,’ says Claire, 35, who lives in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, with her husband Brendan, 42, a fitness centre owner. ‘I blamed my career and lifestyle. At work, I’d have to sit in a dark room and shut my eyes as the pain was all-consuming. Sometimes, the migraines would wipe me out for a week. Claire O’Meara (pictured) used to put her regular, excruciating migraines down to the stress of her high-flying career in sports marketing . ‘Despite being a virtual workaholic, there were times I was unable to function and would have to phone in sick, which left me feeling terribly guilty.’ Things got so bad that last year Claire gave up her job to work part-time for her husband, helping to market his firm. But then Claire had an epiphany when she began keeping a diary of her headaches — her migraines were linked to her menstrual cycle. ‘I noticed they always came the day before my period, and it was a relief to finally realise what the trigger was. ‘It altered the way I tried to deal with them. I took advice, mapped out my cycles, and upped my dosage of magnesium (said to regulate hormones) and took over-the-counter drug Migraleve to try to prevent a migraine coming on 24 hours before I knew my period was due. This has staved off a full-blown migraine for the last few months.’ Claire is not the only woman suffering from this commonly misdiagnosed side-effect of the menstrual cycle. Claire (pictured after a migraine) gave up her job to work part-time for her husband last year when the migraines got really bad . According to charity the National Migraine Centre, a staggering 50 per cent of women suffer menstrual migraines immediately before, during or just after their period. But, like Claire, very many don’t make the connection between the two for years — and neither do their GPs. Online forums are awash with women discussing the ‘lightbulb moment’ they finally realised their cycle was to blame. Although migraines are an age-old problem, the diagnosis of specific menstrual migraines is a modern phenomenon, following extensive research over the past 25 years. Professor Anne MacGregor, a leading specialist in headaches and women’s health, says: ‘The most common cause is a drop in oestrogen towards the end of the cycle. This hormone is released at the start of it, and levels rise, eventually triggering ovulation and an egg’s release. Claire (pictured) has seen various GPs and doctors about her severe migraines but none have been able to come up with a treatment that has worked completely . ‘Progesterone is released and prepares the womb lining for a fertilised egg. If pregnancy doesn’t occur, both levels drop and cause a period. ‘It’s this sudden drop that triggers a migraine as the body deals with the hormone withdrawal.’ She says hormones used in contraceptives, such as the Pill, coil and patch put all women of menstruating age at risk — but those in their 30s and 40s more so. ‘This is because hormone levels fluctuate more in the years building up to the menopause, mean ing the drop in oestrogen and therefore withdrawal symptoms are greater,’ she reveals. ‘Traditional headache remedies don’t work. This is why we’d like to see greater diagnosis, so women can get the right treatment.’ Claire’s work was not the only thing that suffered. She often found herself saying to Brendan: ‘Not tonight, darling, I’ve a headache’ — and meaning it. ‘Thank goodness he’s very understanding,’ she says. Her social life was often wrecked, too: ‘I’ve had to regularly cancel social engagements, including a close friend’s baby shower.’ Claire saw various doctors: her GP, another for a second opinion, plus a consultant — but none came up with a treatment that worked completely. ‘All they suggested was that I take Migraleve, but until I started taking it as a preventative measure it did nothing to help me.’ Dr Jud Pearson, at the National Migraine Centre, advises patients who suspect their headaches may be menstruation-related to start keeping a diary like Claire. ‘I think women have always suspected they have menstrual migraines but doctors have not always believed them until now. ‘Now, however, there is a growing awareness of the condition, which means more women are finally being diagnosed.’ Marie Brown 47, a dental company sales consultant living in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, has had migraines for more than a decade, but only found out two years ago they were linked to her menstrual cycle, thanks to the migraine diary she was keeping. Marie Brown, 47, (pictured) has also suffered from severe migraines for more than ten years but only discovered two years ago that they are related to her periods . She reveals: ‘The first migraine I suffered was in my late 30s, and even going from bed to bathroom caused agonising pain in my head. There were times I wondered whether the headaches were a symptom of something horribly sinister, such as a brain tumour.’ Only when the migraines became a monthly occurrence, at age 44, did Marie made the connection. She now has a supply of the migraine drug Sumatriptan on hand to take on her ‘danger’ days to prevent attacks. ‘It was such a relief to finally find something that worked for me. But if I don’t take a tablet in time, the ensuing migraine is hell.’ Even with the medication, she still plans her social life and work meetings around her periods. ‘I deliberately don’t book anything for the week of my period, as on so many occasions I’ve had to bolt when a migraine has started. Marie (seen here age 27) uses medication to combat the headaches but still has to plan her social life and meetings around her periods . ‘Last New Year’s Eve I had to abandon dinner with my partner and go to bed at 10pm, when one came on. ‘Unlike most women, I’m actually longing for the menopause in the hope that once my periods stop, so too will the migraines.’ For Sarah Rose, 31, a special educational needs support assistant who lives in Croydon, Surrey, with partner Paul, 33, a sales manager, and their son Jack, two, the severity of monthly menstrual migraines was so great last Easter that her GP sent her to A&E fearing she had a bleed on the brain. ‘I spent five days in hospital on morphine. A CT scan ruled out anything sinister, but I had felt as though my head would literally explode. It was so frightening, all I could think was my lovely little boy needs his mummy and what if something serious was happening to me?’ Marie (pictured) suffered her first migraine in her late 30s, but they became a monthly occurrence when she reached 44, at which point Marie connected the pain to her menstrual cycle . However, unlike many other women, Sarah has suffered from menstrual migraines for all of the years of her adult life. ‘I first had the headaches at school but blamed exam stress for them. They worsened at university and my GP sent me to a neurologist. ‘He diagnosed migraines, but didn’t link them to my cycle. ‘It wasn’t until I was talking to my great aunt, now in her 80s five years ago, that I realised the cause. She said she used to suffer terrible migraines during her period and suspected this was my problem, too. ‘After that, I used the Period Tracker Deluxe mobile phone app to record my symptoms and periods and, sure enough, a pattern soon emerged. ‘Subsequently I also tried homeopathy, specifically a herbal remedy called sepia, which is supposed to help problems associated with your period problems.’ Sarah is an extreme case. But, for many women, the stark facts are that a migraine is another monthly misery they have to endure.

'Our policy is that we won't bid for almost any tournaments while the current leadership is there. 'We would be much more interested in bidding for Euro 2028 because we like UEFA but it is a very long time away still.' England will host the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 at Wembley - the competition is being played in 13 countries across Europe. The United States are favourites to be named as hosts of the 2026 World Cup - Asia cannot bid as Qatar, an Asian federation country, is hosting the 2022 tournament and Europe has 2018 in Russia.

    It took a full and frank exchange of views to rejuvenate Nir Bitton’s Celtic career. The Israeli midfielder has emerged as one of Ronny Deila’s key players this season. A likely candidate for a lucrative future transfer. Yet the penny took time to drop. Omitted from the Celtic manager’s early first-team squads, a conversation between the pair became unavoidable. Israeli midfielder Nir Bitton has become a key player for Celtic after struggling to adapt at first . The Norwegian talked. Bitton listened. Crucially, he also learned what it would take to salvage his Celtic career. ‘I prefer the conversation between me and the gaffer to stay between me and him,’ said Bitton. ‘But at the beginning of the season there were a couple of things I didn’t understand in terms of what he expected from me. ‘Sometimes you need a conversation with the gaffer to understand what he wants from you. To understand what he expects from you as a player and a professional.’ Bitton needed a conversation with manager Ronny Deila before the penny finally dropped for him . The temptation for any player out of the team is to blame the coach but Deila told Bitton to look a little closer to home. Speaking in recent weeks, the Celtic boss said: ‘If you put everything on the coach then you are lost, you are finished. ‘You have to go into yourself and ask “Why am I not playing? Why is that guy in front of me?” and when you find that out you have to think “OK, what do I do to get better?” ‘It’s not the other way around, that the coach gives you a chance and then you play well. ‘You have to show in training that you are good enough and then you get your chance, and Nir has done that.’ Pushed on the issue, Bitton will plead guilty on all counts. ‘Of course I had to look at myself,’ he admitted. ‘When you don’t play the first thing you say is: “It’s the gaffer.” 'That’s what everybody says. ‘But after you go home you think honestly: “OK, what am I doing wrong?” ‘I understood that I needed to change myself, that I needed to improve. It’s difficult sometimes to be honest if you have the wrong attitude. But if you want success you must change to do things the way the gaffer wants. ‘I said to myself, if I don’t change I will find myself out of this club. ‘It’s not easy when you are not playing so you need to have a good attitude and a strong mentality — you need to show the gaffer you want to change.’ Bitton is keen to play in the Scottish League Cup final this weekend, but is struggling with injury . In his first season there were glimpses of promise, yet he admits the culture shift and weather were difficult to negotiate. ‘This is one of the reasons it was hard last season. In Israel, 80 per cent of the days are 24 or 25 degrees. Then you come to Scotland and... it’s not quite the same.’ His wife is in Glasgow now and, with regular games, he has adapted to Scottish football to a point where Charlie Mulgrew faces a battle to resume his midfield partnership with Scott Brown. Learning to press and harry was one of the aspects he had to improve, conceding: ‘The gaffer wants to play a certain way. ‘Before I thought, “OK, I’m a good player, I don’t need to change everything. If the gaffer wants me to play he will, if not I will sit on the bench, I don’t care”, stuff like that. ‘But everyone wants to play. You can train 10 times a day but it’s not the same.’ The midfielder has had some swelling on his ankle, after suffering an injury against Dundee United last week . With the inhospitable climate and culture the Israeli admits he could have returned home. Or tried his fortunes elsewhere. ‘The easiest thing would be to not care and just go back to Israel and not want to be here any more,’ he added. ‘But that’s not me. I just want to show everyone I deserve to play.’ The battle ahead of Sunday’s League Cup Final is of a different kind. Bitton suffered ankle swelling against Dundee United in the Scottish Cup last weekend and is fighting to prove his fitness for Hampden. ‘I still have another four days. We will see. ‘At the end of the day I will take the final decision. ‘If I feel I can play and help the team I will play. ‘If I feel I can play but not at 100 per cent I will take the decision to protect it for the next games. But we have four more days before the game and that’s a long time. I hope I will be fine.’ Bitton has admitted that it took some time to adapt to life - and the weather - in Scotland . The opportunity to win his first domestic trophy at the national stadium as a Celtic player beckons. Yet he is adamant he won’t put his own interests before those of the team adding: ‘I have to be honest with my team-mates. If somebody cannot give 100 per cent for the team there is no reason he should play. ‘If I can give 100 per cent I will play. If not I will be ready for the next games.’ Sunday marks the first step towards a Treble Deila has very publicly and vocally targeted. The norm is to talk down domestic clean sweeps to lessen expectations, yet Bitton accepts that — whatever people say in the public domain — the onus is on Celtic to win everything. ‘Of course it’s hard. ‘Everybody just expects us to win all the titles. But everybody saw the game on Sunday and it will be very difficult for us. ‘We all need to do our jobs as well as we can. But we don’t think about what they say outside the club, we just need to play our game. If we do we can do it.’

    Aditya Mehta was a surprise home finalist at the inaugural Indian Open but his hopes of repeating the feat were killed off by Ricky Walden on Thursday. The 29-year-old surpassed all expectations in October 2013, when Peter Ebdon, Mark Williams and Stephen Maguire were among his victims, before Ding Junhui inflicted a 5-0 defeat on the Indian cueman in the title match. Nudged back in the calendar to March this season, 50th-ranked Mehta would have longed to put together another decent run in his home tournament, but the figure of world number eight Walden loomed large in the draw. Ricky Walden saw off Aditya Mehta to deny the Indian a repeat success at his home tournament . And International Championship winner Walden came through a 4-2 winner to reach the last 16, where China's Tian Pengfei awaits him. Former world champions John Higgins and Williams advanced, Scotsman Higgins winning 4-2 against Jamie Cope and Welshman Williams with a final-frame break of 127 to fend off one-time Crucible king Ebdon 4-3. Next up for Williams is world number six Judd Trump, who was given a scare by amateur Adam Duffy and was far from persuasive as he edged through 4-3. Trump has been struggling with a shoulder injury and even considered withdrawing from the tournament. Trump said after beating Duffy: 'The shoulder is better than it was in my first match, though it is still not perfect. 'I don't expect much tomorrow, I will just battle like I did today and see what happens. I'm not going to play my best here. I just need to try to be patient because I know I'm going to miss balls that I don't usually miss.' Williams is hoping to hang around in Mumbai - because he is smitten by the local cuisine. Williams said, according to World Snooker's website: 'I've had two curries a day since I've been here. They are the best curries I've ever had, better than anything back home. If my wife asks me next week if want to go for a curry, I'll definitely have to say no.' Graeme Dott, the 2006 world champion, breezed to a 4-0 win over David Morris, with others through to the last 16 including Jamie Jones, Mark Davis, Kyren Wilson, Michael White, Nigel Bond and Chris Wakelin - the 22-year-old Warwickshire potter reaching the last 16 of a ranking event for the first time after a 4-1 victory over Andrew Pagett.

    (CNN)For over two decades, bassist Mike Porcaro was a rock star with the band Toto, playing venues around the world. Now, the music world is mourning the death of Porcaro, who died after a battle with Lou Gehrig's disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS. He was 59. "Our brother Mike passed away peacefully in his sleep at 12:04 AM last night at home surrounded by his family," Porcaro's brother Steve, the band's keyboardist, posted on Facebook on Sunday. "Rest in peace, my brother," About 10 years ago, Porcaro started noticing weakness in his fingers and hands. He was diagnosed with the disease in 2006. Former members of his band -- known for hits such as "Africa" and "Rosanna" -- rallied to help. They reunited for a brief European tour in 2010 in support of Porcaro. Toto vocalist and guitarist Steve Lukather also called Porcaro a brother. "My brother Mike Porcaro is now now at peace," he tweeted. "I will miss him more than I could ever put into words. My deepest love to the family. God Bless" ALS is a fast-moving, usually fatal disease of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It affects more than 30,000 people at any given time.

    A stately-home has been transported back to its condition in the Second World War after six months of painstaking restoration. Today, the hard work paid off as the time-capsule building was re-opened by The Great British Bake-off's Mary Berry. Mary opened the Warwickshire stately home to celebrate the house's incredible transformation and to mark the seventieth anniversary of the end of the conflict. Mary Berry re-opened Upton House in Warwickshire that has been restored to the state it was in 1939 . Upton House, a National Trust property located in the parish of Ratley and Upton, has been transported back in time to 1939, when London-based bank M.Samuel & Co moved into the building as they were at risk of having their premises demolished in the London Blitz. The house became one of only two country house banks during the war, the other being the Bank of England. Mary, 80, opened the newly-refurbished house after a team of 80 volunteers went to extraordinary lengths to recreate the manor, even sourcing two rolls of 75-year-old toilet paper. Other fastidious details include WW2 toothpaste, oil from that era that would have been used in typewriters and the team even made lipstick from boiled beetroot, which was common practice at the time. London-based bank M.Samuel & Co moved into the property as they were at risk of having their own building demolished in the London Blitz . The house took six months of painstaking restoration to restore it to its former state . Rachael O'Connor-Boyd, head of Museum Collections Manager at Warwickshire County Council who oversaw the project at the National Trust property, said it was essential to include the tiny, everyday objects in the faithful recreation of the house, which took six months. The 37-year-old said: 'We do need the ephemeral details like toilet paper and I got a bit obsessed with 1940s toilet paper. 'We searched high and low and eventually some toilet paper came up on eBay. We did eventually get two rolls of wartime loo roll that I was very happy with.' Mary Berry opened the stately home to celebrate the house's incredible transformation and to mark the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War . Although Rachael was able to get hold of the hard-to-find product she admits that even when they were available in 1939, not many people would have had access to it. 'It's very rare as, at the time, people would generally not have used it, they would have used scraps of paper or even newspaper in some households.' This level of intricate detail has permeated every aspect of the recreation of Upton House. Sourcing loo rolls: Among the objects bought were two rolls of 75-year-old toilet tissue costing £30 each . Many of the props were sourced online but the team had also received donations from collectors . The bathrooms are stocked with toothpaste and toothbrushes from the era. Even pens and pencils have been found from the 1940s to fill the desks in the house. Rachael says that a lot of the material has been discovered online through six months of research, but they have also been fortunate enough to receive invaluable donations. She said: 'There are some things that you do not know that you want and then when you get them they are perfect. Rachael O'Connor-Boyd who oversaw the project said it was important to gather everyday items . Girl of her time: Mary Berry would have been just four-years-old in 1939 . 'One instance would be 1940s tea that came in a cardboard box in wrapped up packets with hand written notes. They had been in somebody's attic for 70 years and was in a pristine condition. 'A lot of the items we received were from the kindness of strangers.' In order to create a high level of accuracy the team had to be prepared to spend more than one would usually on household items. The toilet paper alone cost £60 for the two rolls. Rachael says that the project wouldn't have been possible without people who had decided to preserve such items. 'There are some glorious people out there that keep everything and if it weren't for people who kept things in their loft or their attics, we wouldn't have these objects and that window into a world that's gone.' She said finding the everyday items for the house was vital to faithfully recreate the home's wartime story. She added: 'I honed onto things like the toilet paper because it's ordinary peoples' lives and that's important to our story because it's a mansion where for that period during the war, ordinary people took over this extraordinary place.'

    Gathered in their hundreds, spectators crowd round to watch as two dogs are forced to fight to the death in barbaric cages. These shocking scenes from northern China drew outrage from animal rights activists in the country, who have called for a change in the law to protect the canines. But the local villagers who organised the event have defended the dogfights as necessary 'entertainment' in an isolated part of the country. Scroll down for video . Barbaric: These shocking scenes from northern China drew outrage from animal rights activists in the country . Bloody: The competition was open to anyone who brought a dog along and the winner of each bout was rewarded with a pack of cigarettes and a china mug . Spectacle: Hundreds of people turn up to watch the dogfights in northern China, which are held to mark the finale of the Spring Festival celebrations in the region . The dogfights, which lasted over several days, were organised by six villagers in Sanjiao village in Jishan county in northern China's Shanxi province to mark the finale of the Spring Festival celebrations. The competition was open to anyone who brought a dog along, and the winner of each bout was rewarded with a pack of cigarettes and a china mug. One of the organisers, Shi Pan, 45, protested that because the village was in a poor rural area, the locals had to resort to creating their own entertainment. He said: 'People in the city criticise our dogfights but they have all sorts of money to pay for entertainments which we don't have access to. We have to organise things to entertain ourselves.' While banned in some countries, dogfights are a common attraction in northern China which hosts more than 100 festivals each year attracting visitors from neighboring provinces and tourists alike. Police have said the event did not breach any laws and that there have been no official complaints. They added that some of the people who who turned up had allegedly grabbed stray dogs off the street, and claimed they were their pets. Attraction: While banned in some countries, dog fights are a common attraction in northern China . Violent: Despite the vicious scenes sparking outrage, organisers have insisted that the dogfights are part of the traditional 'entertainment' in the area . Brutal: The dogs are forced to fight to the death in cages, leading to calls from animal rights activists for new cruelty laws . Rural: Organiser Shi Pan declared the dogfights as a 'great success' and added: 'We plan to do the same thing next year' China has no animal cruelty laws, and a person who damages a dog or another animal can only be prosecuted for damaging property if the animal belongs to somebody. Dogfighting is illegal, but only if it involves bets. Simply allowing the animals to fight purely for entertainment comes into a grey area where it is difficult to prosecute anyone involved. Chung Lu, an animal rights activist in the country said, said: 'Events like these are exactly why we need a functioning animal cruelty law in China, because people do that they want and get away with it unless they know the law can stop them.' But a defiant Shi Pan said: 'It was a great success, we plan to do the same thing again next year. And we don't care what the people in the city say.'

    It's a milestone age that many women face with trepidation. However, approaching 50 doesn't appear to be phasing Elizabeth Hurley. Estee Lauder has renewed her contract for the 21st year in a row, she has a lead role in the new (and unapologetically daft) US series The Royals and her swimwear line is selling well in Saks Fifth Avenue and Harrods. It's now nearly 21 years since the British actress, model and businesswoman  was catapulted into the spotlight at the Four Weddings and a Funeral Premiere. Scroll down for video . Looking regal at nearly 50: Elizabeth Hurley, pictured above promoting new US television series The Royals, puts her enduring beauty down to covering herself in moisturiser from a young age . Show-stopper: The Versace dress worn by Elizabeth at the premiere for Four Weddings and a Funeral put her on the front page of every newspaper. She calls the dress 'a landmark dress in fashion history' Just being on Hugh Grant's arm would have garnered headlines enough but famously pouring herself into that revealing black Versace dress saw her steal the entire show, even if she was thereafter constantly referred to as 'Hugh Grant's girlfriend'. Elizabeth tells the Times that the moment was actually less about her and all about the dress: 'It was such a landmark dress in fashion history. Like nothing to do with me. It was the dress.' The black, strappy ensemble, seemingly held together with large gold safety pins, kickstarted her previously quiet career which, two decades on, has seen her try her hand at everything from acting and modelling to owning her own organic food company and designing her own swimwear. Her looks have very much remained flawless despite the ageing process. Still pin thin, there's barely a wrinkle on her, something which she puts down to nothing more than a lifetime of lathering on moisturiser - with at least SPF30 if she's in the sun - and a great diet. If plenty of older female stars have spoken out about ageism against women recently, any obvious discrimination seems to have passed Elizabeth by. She says there are 'a lot of girls who are doing advertising campaigns who are my age or more. It's a very nice time as far as that's concerned.' 'Quite sexy': Elizabeth's new show The Royals sees her play Queen Helena, based on an 'obviously fictitious' royal family living in modern-day London. Joan Collins plays her mother and was handpicked by Elizabeth . Flawless skin (...and plenty of diamonds): The star (pictured left in a recent selfie) says she hasn't experienced ageism in Hollywood and has had her 21-year contract with Estee Lauder renewed . It's hard to believe but exercise has hardly featured 'for years' thanks to a gruelling work regime that means she doesn't find it easy to make time for working out. Her current schedule, she says, sees her picked up at dawn and not home until 8:30pm in the evening. New show The Royals, described as 'obviously fictitious' sees Elizabeth playing the character of Queen Helena reigning over modern-day England, with Joan Collins, who was handpicked by her, playing her mother. She says of the show: 'It's fun, it's a drama - it's not a comedy but it's lighthearted. It's quite sexy.' She admits that her 12-year-old son Damian, born in 2002 to entrepreneur Steve Bing, was privy to some of the racier scenes, having spent part of his school holidays on the set. Father and son: Liz fell pregnant in 2001 by business magnate Steve Bing. Although Mr Bing denied that Damian, now 12, (right) was his child, a DNA test proved otherwise . Taking a sabbatical from relationships: After plenty of romances including a marriage to Arun Nayar, an engagement to Shane Warne and a short friendship with financier David Yarrow, Elizabeth is enjoying a break . Still the one? They've been apart longer than they were together but the lives of Elizabeth and Hugh are still very much entwined with both being godparent to the other one's child. Hugh is pictured above with Elizabeth's son Damian at a fundraising event in 2013 . After a string of high-profile relationships, Elizabeth seems to be settling for the single life as she approaches her fifties. Speaking on The Jonathan Ross show, she said: 'I am single. On sabbatical. I'm busy at the moment, family, work, I'm working more now than I ever have been, no time for love.' Her life is, she readily admits, still entwined with former beau Hugh Grant's. Although the couple have now been apart for longer than they were together, there seems to be few signs of the friendship fading. The actor is godfather to her son Damian, born in 2002 to entrepreneur Steve Bing and she has returned the favour, being godmother to one of Hugh's daughters, Tabitha. She told Jonathan Ross: 'We're best friends. He lives next door to me and he's godfather to my son and I'm godmother to one of his children. 'We've been apart for longer than we were together. We were together for 13 years and then we've been best friends for 15.' When pushed by the television presenter on a possible romantic reunion, she dismissed the idea, saying: 'I don't think that's going to happen...but he's the best friend that anyone could have.' After a brief dalliance with Steve Bing which resulted in a DNA test to prove his paternity of Damian, she married Indian textile heir Arun Nayar in 2007 after a five-year relationship, with a ceremony in the UK and a lavish six-day ceremony in Jodhpur, India. A new episode in the life of Elizabeth: The star has been promoting new E! show The Royals . When the relationship crumbled five years ago, a series of headline-grabbing romances followed including an engagement to Australian cricketer Shane Warne. Her most recent paramour was said to be hedge-fund financier and wildlife photographer Steve Yarrow. It seems, with son Damian, a small herd of pets to nurture including five dogs, chickens, alpacas and piglets, that she already has more than enough affection in her life. 'I am much more country girl than town girl. When I had my son, it got quite difficult in London to get any privacy and so I bought a farm in the country, in Gloucestershire and lived out there for a while and did full-time farming.' The actress has a rather clever way too of filtering out calls to her office too. She's known by close family not as 'Liz' or 'Elizabeth' but an undisclosed moniker. 'No-one calls me Liz or Elizabeth. If someone rings the office and says anything about 'Liz', we know they've never met me.'

    A vicious fight between teenage girls that was caught on camera is under investigation by the Houston Police Department. Footage of the brawl was shared on Twitter on Sunday night. The police department learned of the scrap after a user tagged them in the video on the social networking site. One video shows a group of girls gathered in a parking lot before one of the teenagers, who is wearing blue jeans, forces another girl to the ground and repeatedly punches her in the face. The girl on the ground attempts to protect her face with her arms but her attacker gets several punches in before getting up and apparently stomping on the girl's face. Violent: Two girls can be seen fighting in a parking lot in Humble, Texas. The video of the incident was widely shared across Twitter on Sunday night and caught the attention of the Houston Police Department . Scrap: Other girls stand by and watch as the fight - just one caught on camera that day - unfold before them . After the attack, the girl remains sprawled on the floor, apparently unable to get up, and is helped to her feet by two friends, according to the video first shared byKPRC 2. During the fight, bystanders watch and shout words of encouragement rather than alerting authorities. Another video also shared online shows the same girl in blue jeans in a fight with another girl, apparently at the same parking lot. In that footage, the two girls drag each other across the parking lot by their hair as onlookers continue to shout at them. Two teenagers in the video told KPRC that they went to the parking lot after learning that the fight was going to be held near to an elementary school in Humble. But Humble Independent School District said the fight did not take place on a school's campus. Brutal: In an even more disturbing cell phone video, the girl in blue jeans pins a different girl down and repeatedly punches her before stomping on her head . 'It is unclear if those involved are students, but school district police and administrators will be viewing the video to assist investigators in identifying those involved,' it said in a statement. The Harris County Sheriff's Department and the Houston Police Department are investigating. They have not yet responded to comment on whether any arrests have been made or if any of the girls in the video have been identified. It is also unknown what injuries the girls sustained in the fight. After the video was shared online, one Twitter user sent a message to the Houston Police Department tagging one of the girls but her profile has since been removed.

    (CNN)A neglected maid, a hit man and a shoe expert are heading to theaters this weekend with the releases of "Cinderella," "Run All Night" and "The Cobbler." Here's what The Hollywood Reporter's critics are saying about the weekend's new offerings (as well as which film will likely top the weekend's box office). Director Kenneth Branagh's film stars Cate Blanchett, Lily James, Richard Madden and Helena Bonham Carter in a retelling of the fairy tale about a young woman whose oppressive stepmother stands in the way of her feelings for a dashing prince. THR film critic David Rooney writes in his review that "anyone nostalgic for childhood dreams of transformation will find something to enjoy in an uplifting movie that invests warm sentiment in universal themes of loss and resilience, experience and maturity." More: The best and worst adaptations of "Cinderella" Liam Neeson, Ed Harris and Joel Kinnaman star in director Jaume Collet-Serra's crime film about a hit man trying to save his estranged son from a revenge plot. THR chief film critic Todd McCarthy writes in his review that the film is Neeson's "latest slab of amped-up urban mayhem" and "consists entirely of angry threats, pointed guns, hiding out from and eluding same, and mad dashes down mean streets on foot and in vehicles." More: Liam Neeson says he's quitting action movies in two years . Director Alex Gibney's documentary focuses on Scientology and its ties to Hollywood. "This impeccably assembled and argued film represents a brave, timely intervention into debates around the organization that have been simmering for some time," writes THR film critic Leslie Felperin in her review. Adam Sandler, Steve Buscemi, Dustin Hoffman, Ellen Barkin and Dan Stevens star in director Thomas McCarthy's comedy about a dissatisfied shoe repairman who is magically able to live his customers' lives by wearing their footwear. THR film critic John DeFore describes the film as "likeable but ordinary" in his review. A woman isn't pleased when she learns her husband is cheating on her in director Anthony Burns' dark comedy. Katherine Heigl, Patrick Wilson and Jordana Brewster star. "The kind of blithely confident, creatively impoverished dud that leaves you slightly stunned someone greenlighted it, the movie has the distinction of feeling like a bad idea from its very first frames," according to THR film critic Jon Frosch's review. More "Cinderella": Lily James, Richard Madden guess why British actors keep getting cast in Disney fairy tales . Pianist Seymour Bernstein is the subject of this documentary from director Ethan Hawke. THR film critic Stephen Farber writers in his review that "the film is a loving portrait of Seymour Bernstein," although "one might want to know a little more about his personal history." ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter.

    Manuel Pellegrini admits Manchester City need a 'crack' player to take them to the next level. The term is used in Spain to describe a world star, a galactico, who can transform the team. The reigning Premier League champions saw their hopes of retaining the title diminish after a shock 1-0 defeat by Burnley on Saturday. Here Sportsmail identifies five names City have considered as they approach a pivotal summer in their development. Manuel Pellegrini insists Sergio Aguero needs another 'crack' player to support him at the Etihad . Despite his expensively assembled squad, Pellegrini still thinks City need more star quality . Aguero failed to score as the champion's hopes of retaining the title suffered a blow against Burnley . PAUL POGBA . Juventus £55m . City have trailed Pogba since he was on their doorstep at Manchester United. The 22-year-old can be the dominant force in City's midfield for years to come and add the extra energy they have lacked this year. Juventus general director Giuseppe Marotta said: 'There are many suitors for Pogba, but we do not want to open negotiations and we want him to stay with us.' That said if clubs offer £55m it will be difficult for the Italians to reject. Chances: 4/5 . Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has become one of the world's best midfielders at Juve . The Italians insist Pogba is not for sale but an offer in excess of £55m could prove too tempting . KEVIN de BRUYNE . Wolfsburg £35m . Has grown into one of the best midfielders in Europe on current form. He is playing as a No 10, dominating games, creating chances and scoring goals. The Belgian could prove to be one of Jose Mourinho's biggest mistakes. Yes, Chelsea made a profit when they sold him but he now looks a player who can have greater influence on a game than Oscar and Willian. City have watched him closely this season and Wolfsburg expect a bid. Chances: 4/5 . The Belgium international has been starring in the Bundesliga since his move from Chelsea to Wolfsburg . The Belgium international's recent form has raised questions over why Jose Mourinho let him leave Chelsea . KOKE . Atletico Madrid £44m . The jewel in the crown of Atletico Madrid. Managers have gone to watch him and questioned whether he was big and strong enough for the Premier League but he is 5ft 10ins and, like the smaller Marco Verratti at Paris St Germain, Koke has the athleticism and strength which allows him to handle the rough treatment. Has proven at European and domestic level he is a player of repute. Much will depend where Diego Simeone ends up. Chances: 2/5 . Atletico Madrid's pass master Koke is seen as the heir in waiting to Barcelona's Xavi in Spain . Koke celebrates his goal against Valencia with former Chelsea striker Fernando Torres (right) GARETH BALE . Real Madrid £75m . Bale is determined to ride out the storm in Madrid but won't be short of admirers should he opt to leave. Despite the fuss over Manchester United's overtures to him, Bale was aware of City's interest prior to his departure from Tottenham and would listen if his time at Madrid was up. A homegrown player to boot, he has matured since leaving White Hart Lane and would give City the pace and direct dynamic they have lacked this season. Chances: 3/5 . Gareth Bale's struggles to win over Real Madrid's fickle fans could lead to a return to the Premier League . Bale scored twice in the weekend win over Levante, which will have pleased some fans if not Cristiano Ronaldo . VIDEO Bale double silences critics . CRISTIANO RONALDO . Real Madrid £80m . Surely not? The chat among some City players last week was that Cristiano Ronaldo was destined for Manchester and not the Old Trafford side. It's almost unthinkable considering his affection for all things United. His agent Jorge Mendes says he will retire at Madrid but tensions are undoubtedly high as the unforgiving Bernabeu crowd see fit to criticise a phenomenal player who has scored 280 goals for them. Chances: 1/5 . They say never say never, but surely Cristiano Ronaldo signing for United's rivals is unimaginable? The Ballon d'Or holder was supposed to finish his career at the Bernabeu but has cut a frustrated figure .

Summary target: 
    Manuel Pellegrini has said Man City need another 'crack' player in squad .
Real Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale have been mooted .
A return to Manchester for former United ace Paul Pogba is on the cards .
Former Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne and Atletico Madrid pass master Koke are other alternatives .

Throughout the clip - uploaded to YouTube on February 26 - he takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to showcase his abilities.

Lastly, the Snapchat job specification asks for someone who is an 'expert in sending ugly selfies to friends.' Felson happily fulfills the prerequisite by striking a pose at the camera with his nose pushed up in an unattractive manner. He finishes by claiming that 'he's the man for the job' and just one class away from finishing his MBA.

He said that he got the idea of applying to Snapchat after walking past their office in Venice. His dream role would be one that has a creative aspect.

'I love interacting with people so, if I were offered some type of job on camera, I would definitely entertain it,' the hopeful graduate concluded. Source of inspiration: Felson made his comical Snapchat video by tackling each one of the job requirements one by one - he is yet to hear back from the company .

    Swatch, the world's . largest watchmaker unveiled its riposte to Apple's smartwatch. It plans to put cheap . programmable chips in watches that will let wearers from China . to Chicago make payments with a swipe of the wrist. Swatch Group will start offering watches with near . field communication (NFC) chips within two months, said at a news conference on the company's . annual results which were released last month. Scroll down for video . We're coming for you Apple! Swatch chief executive Nick Hayek said Apple's launch was a 'fantastic opportunity' for the Swiss watchmaker. The rewards are potentially huge for whoever comes up with a winning formula. Andrew Sheehy, chief analyst at Generator Research, sees the retail value of wearable Internet-connected devices at $93.1 billion by 2018, versus $4.1 billion in 2014, with smartwatches accounting for about two thirds of the market's value in 2018. Apple's move into watches would open up a market where . Swatch was already well positioned to compete, he said. The Swiss company's strategy appears to revolve around . including individual tech features in different models rather . than going head to head with Apple, the world's most valuable . firm, to create all-in-one smartwatches combining many . functions. 'We are the world champions of integrating smart functions . into a watch,' Hayek said. 'We don't want to produce a mini . mobile phone on your wrist. Others can do that.' At 1600 GMT, Swatch shares were up 2.7 percent at 432.1 . Swiss francs. Apple's watch will go on sale in nine countries starting in . April, priced from $349 for the smaller model and $549 for the . standard version, although a high-end 'Edition' watch will sell . for at least $10,000. 'It's a fantastic opportunity for us. It is opening the . market. 'Especially in the U.S., many people are not wearing . watches any more. Somebody is opening this up. Let Apple do the . work. It's fine. It's good. I congratulate them.' The new connected watch 'Swatch Touch Zero One'which will go on sale within months . Both firms' strategies could co-exist and succeed, Hayek . said, before adding a dig at the bigger rival: 'Upgrading . software every year, that's not our business.' For its near-field chips, which will cost around 2 francs . ($2) per watch, Swatch has teamed up with China UnionPay, the . Chinese credit card association, as well as a Swiss bank and a . major credit card company. The credit card company, described as an Olympics sponsor, . is likely to be Visa, a long-time backer of the event. Visa was not immediately available to comment. Swatch is also launching a range of sports-themed 'Swatch . Touch' smartwatches which will be able to 'buddy up' with a . smartphone via a Bluetooth connection. The first model will retail at 135 francs, about twice the . cost of a regular Swatch watch with an NFC chip.

    Fewer families are taking holidays during term time in the wake of a government crackdown on absenteeism, new figures suggest. The number of days missed by holidaying pupils decreased by almost a third in the past year after a ban on taking children out of lessons for trips. Parents have been fined up to £1,000 and even taken to court since the new policy came into force in September 2013. Drop: Figures reveal just 3million school days were missed by pupils last year - down 1.4million on 2012-13 . Yesterday, Department for Education figures showed 3million days were missed for holidays in 2013-14, down from 4.4million in 2012-13. The latest figure represents a decrease of more than two fifths from 2009-10, when 5.3million days were missed. Government statisticians said the drop has been fuelled by a fall in the number of authorised breaks - trips approved by the school. There has been a slight rise in the number of unauthorised holidays - indicating that some parents may be deciding to take their child out of school without permission, and instead run the risk of a fine. The latest figures, for the last academic year, are the first to show the impact of strict new rules on pupil absence introduced by former education secretary Michael Gove. Under the changes, heads are now only able to grant leave in ‘exceptional circumstances’ and parents can be fined £60 per pupil for taking term time holidays without permission. The cost rises to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days. Fines: The drop is being credited on the new fines system, which sees parents landed with a £60 penalty if they take their children out of school for an 'unauthorised' absence . Those who fail to pay can face prosecution, with a maximum fine, if convicted, of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months. The National Association of Head Teachers released guidance stating exceptions could be made for family funerals and religious events, but family holidays were unlikely to meet the criterion. Campaigners have said the rules impact the hardest on poorer families who cannot afford high travel costs during school breaks, and families with parents that work shifts on or rosters. Travel companies increase their prices significantly in peak seasons when there is more demand. School Reform Minister Nick Gibb said: ‘Every single lost day counts - which is why as part of our plan for education we have put teachers back in charge so they can clamp down on classroom absence. ‘Fewer school days are being lost than ever before thanks to our reforms - giving children the best possible chance to succeed.’

Summary target: 
    Three million days missed last year, say Department for Education figures .
Number down from 4.4million in 2012-13, and 5.3million in 2009-10 .
Drop  comes after fine of £60 per pupil brought in for missing school .
But campaigners say measures impact the hardest on poorer families .

    The twin of a British jihadi bride arrested last week as she arrived back in the UK has told of her fury after missing out on a girls' holiday because of her sister's links to Syria. Jamila Henry, 21, was arrested at Luton airport after landing on a flight from Istanbul. She is thought to have fled the region after the breakdown of her second marriage. Her identical twin Jalila, who lives in Balham, south London, is a self-proclaimed party girl who has admittedly followed a very different path from her Muslim convert sister. Self-proclaimed party girl Jalila Henry (left) has spoken of her shock at her twin sister Jamila's (right) connection to Syria. The 21-year-old  was arrested Luton Airport after landing on a flight from Istanbul . Jalila said while she and her sister were close as children they began following different paths as teenagers. Jamila (right) devoted herself to Islam while her party-loving twin (left) began clubbing late into the night . Speaking for the first time since her sibling's arrest, Jalila has told of her shock at learning the mother of one may have been living alongside the murderous terror group. Jamila has since been charged with possession of an identity document with intent. At a hearing on Saturday morning at Westminster Magistrates Court she spoke only to confirm her name. The 21-year-old did not enter a plea. Her parents and sister were present for the brief hearing. In an interview published on the same day, Jamila's twin told The Sun's Rachel Dale how her plans for a girls' weekend to Amsterdam were scuppered by her sister's scheme. She added she was disappointed with her sister's decision to return to Syria, but that the pair had followed different paths since they were teenagers. 'She seemed completely normal. I don't know what to think, I can't believe she has treated me like this.' Despite growing up in a shared bedroom in their Jehova's Witness mother's home in Streatham, south London, the twins grew apart as teenagers, she added. While Jalila became involved in London's nightclub scene, often staying out until the early hours of the morning, her more reserved sister devoted herself to the Koran. She had converted to Islam while at secondary school where 'it was the "in" thing to do,' her sister said. Jalila, who lives in Balham, south London, said she was disappointed her sister had returned to Syria . Jalila (left) said her sister (right) described Syria as 'beautiful'. The young mother fled to the region after the breakdown of her first marriage to a Muslim Turkish Cypriot . At 18, Jamila married and had a child in the UK. She and her husband became estranged and the increasingly devout youngster fled to Syria with their son. There she is thought to have married an ISIS militant before returning to Britain in December. Upon her arrival she was questioned by police over alleged links to the terror group but was never charged. She returned to the war-torn region alone earlier this year and was picked up by Turkish authorities as she tried to re-enter Syria. Counter terrorism police  picked her up at Luton Airport on Thursday. Speaking of her sister's stints in Syria, Jalila said she thought fondly of the country despite its ongoing turmoil. British teenagers Shamima Begun, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana walk through security at Gatwick airport before boarding a flight to Turkey in February . The girls were later captured on Turkish CCTV preparing to board a bus headed towards the Syrian border . 'She said it was beautiful... she showed me pictures of all the amazing food they made and the house they lived in. 'God knows what was in her mind when she got up and left again. She promised she would never go back.' Last week the pair's mother said she was planning to meet with relatives to discuss her daughter's arrest. Sharmeena Begum was named as the first of four Bethnal Green Academy schoolgirls to have fled home to join ISIS . Jamila was remanded in custody this morning following a brief hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court. Her case will be heard at the Old Bailey on April 7. She was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism but has not been charged. She has not entered a plea with regard to one charge of possessing an identity document with intent. It comes after five teenage girls who took an interest in Syria were banned from travelling abroad amid fears more British youngsters are planning to join the terror organisation. The girls, two of whom are 15 and three 16, had their passports removed by a High Court judge yesterday after concerns over their alleged plans were raised by a local authority. The adults responsible for them were also stripped of their passports.  The previous day a 16-year-old boy from Brighton was also banned from travelling abroad following the deaths of his older brothers, both killed in Syria. Earlier three teenage boys were thrown out of the country after being picked up in Istanbul as they tried to cross the border. Their British parents phoned police after the boys, aged 17 and 19, went missing. Their arrival back in the UK came as footage of three north London schoolgirls who had earlier left the country to join frontline militants emerged. In February Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, all fled to Syria. The girls were captured on CCTV in the UK and in Turkey where they are thought to have been ushered over the border by an ISIS 'fixer' who provided them with false documents. Sharmeena Begum, who went to the same school as the girls in Bethnal Green, travelled to the region before them.

    Forget switchblades it's shears that will be the new weapon of choice for members of New Zealand's notorious Mongrel Mob and Black Power gangs who are set to take up a new community initiative. The New Zealand Herald reports that in July the council of Dunedin City, on the South Island's east coast, will begin an initial programme where the two gangs can apply for basic community work - such as mowing lawns, trimming hedges, and cutting back foliage. Both the Mongrel Mob and Black Power have shared a violent rivalry spanning decades. The gangs have been involved in drug trafficking, alleged murder, and robbery - but last year the gangs surprised everyone by suddenly making peace, not war. The council of Dunedin City, on New Zealand's South Island, will begin an initial programme where the two gangs can apply for basic community work . It's a very different kind of work than they're used to, but the gangs have joined forces in a submission to the Dunedin City Council, asking for help in acquiring paid work to support their families. 'It's remarkable they're working together. They've had a long history of just shooting each other,' Dunedin Mayor Dave Cull said. 'But I think they're both beginning to realise that violence won't provide them much of a future anymore.' Rather than shoot and knife each other the proposal was put forward for them to work together as an employment solution for gang members who were struggling to support their families, and steer them from a life of crime. The Mongrel Mob and Black Power gangs have been involved in drug trafficking, alleged murder and robbery . Mayor Cull explained that as the men approach middle age they've found their reputation and appearance have prevented them from finding traditional and regular employment. In response to concerns that work is being spoon-fed to gang members and that there are others more deserving of the chance, the Dunedin City Council said it will ensure that both Mongrel Mob and Black Power have to meet standard expectations. This includes meeting state health and safety requirements and providing insurance cover like any other commercial landscaping company.

    Three fraudsters who used the names of more than 200 dead children to launder profits from an attempted £1m VAT fraud have been jailed for more than 16 years. Saheed Oyeneye, 35, Rasaq Omotunde, 38, and Oluwakemi Adesaogun, 38, all from south east London, set up hundreds of bogus online HMRC accounts to ‘get rich quick’ off the public purse. The Nigerian-born adopted false identities of hundreds of unsuspecting victims, mirroring the tactic employed by the assassin in The Day of the Jackal, as part of his plot to shoot French president Charles de Gaulle. Rasaq Omotunde, 38 (left) and Saheed Oyeneye, 35, (right), both from south east London, were part of a fraud gang who used the names of more than 200 children to launder profits from an attempted VAT fraud . In a scenario similar to that of the Frederick Forsyth novel, the trio men stole the identities of more than 200 dead British babies, before using their names to bombard the government with tax repayment applications. They also adopted the identities of sports personalities, including cricketers and rugby union stars, by scouring the internet for their personal details and cobbling together a fake profile. The three men also targeted thousands of  members of the public as they attempted to swindle £1m, Southwark Crown Court was told. In total, the gang managed to pocket around £250,000, which was banked across hundreds of accounts which had been set up under false names. But the trio were rumbled early on by HMRC and did not pay out more than three-quarters of the money. When their homes were searched, investigators discovered the personal details of more than 200 dead children were stored on computers, the court heard. At the peak of the fraud, the thieves were using more than 20 internet cafes to register up to 301 new accounts a day. Pictured: Oluwakemi Adesaogun . At the peak of the fraud, the thieves were using more than 20 internet cafes to register up to 301 new accounts a day. Oluwakemi Adesaogun, 38, from Woolwich, was the third member of the group . Oyeneye, from Hither Green, Omotunde, from Sydenham and Adesaogun, from Woolwich, all pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud. Today, Judge Stephen Robbins jailed Oyeneye for five and a half years, Omotunde for six years and Adesaogun for five years. After the sentencing, Christopher Gill, Assistant Director, Criminal Investigation, HMRC, said: ‘This trio thought they were running a high-tech and sophisticated fraud using a series of addresses and internet cafes to set up accounts using stolen data. ‘They bombarded the system with applications for tax repayments from these fake accounts, in the hope of getting rich quick. ‘These fraudsters thought the anonymity of the internet would protect them.' He added: 'This case demonstrates that we can and will track down and prosecute those who attack our online systems. ‘This was nothing but a common repayment fraud attempt which our systems quickly identified as bogus. HMRC shuts down the vast majority of bogus repayment applications.’ The trio will face confiscation proceedings at a later date but most of the money has already vanished. The book's protagonist - the Jackal - trawls three village graveyards looking for the headstone of a baby boy who, had he not died, would have been about the same age as the assassin. Taking the details of the late Alexander James Quentin Duggan to the Central Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths, the Jackal buys a copy of the deceased's birth certificate - all the proof he needs to successfully apply for a passport.

    Arrested again: Radio DJ Neil Fox was arrested after voluntarily attending a central London police station today in connection with a sexual assault . Radio DJ Neil Fox was today arrested for the third time on suspicion of sexual offences. The 53-year-old, who has been suspended from his job at Magic FM while police inquiries continue, is accused of a woman in the 1990s. In September Fox, who lives in Fulham, south west London with his wife and children, was arrested in relation to four alleged incidents against two women. Two months later he revisited a central London police station where he was accused of three more offences. Today Scotland Yard confirmed he had been arrested again in relation to an additional alleged incident. The eight alleged incidents are said to have taken place in the 1990s, in 2007 and in the past year. Fox, a former Pop Idol judge, vehemently denied the allegations after his first arrest. Today a Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Officers from Westminster arrested a 53-year-old man last September following four allegations of sexual assault against two women. 'Three of the allegations are non-recent; one is from earlier this year. 'The man was arrested at a business address in central London and taken to a central London police station. 'Officers subsequently searched addresses in Fulham and the Littlehampton area of West Sussex. 'On Monday December 8th he returned on bail to a central London police station and was arrested for a further three sexual assaults involving different women. 'Two allegations are said have happened in the 1990s, the third was said to have happened in 2007. Scroll down for video . 'Today, he voluntarily attended a central London police station and was further arrested for an allegation of sexual assault against an additional female victim. This offence is said to have happened in the early 1990s. 'The man has now been bailed to return pending further inquiries to a date in late March.' Mr Fox was first held by detectives on September 30 at the Magic FM offices in London just moments after coming off-air . Following his arrest last September the DJ, who rose to fame in the late 1980s at London's Capital Radio, vowed to clear his name. Fox, who uses the nicknames Dr Fox and Foxy, began his career in local radio before moving to Radio Luxembourg and then London's Capital Radio in the late 1980s. He presented various slots there and in 1993, landed the job of presenting the Sunday afternoon Network Chart Show, later known as the Pepsi chart. His big TV break, which brought him to a wider audience, was as a judge on ITV talent show Pop Idol between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman, and Nicki Chapman. Fox later appeared in the BBC Three sketch show The Wrong Door. He left Capital in 2005 and joined Magic 105.4, where he presented the breakfast show until being suspended following his arrest last September. Speaking outside the south west London home where he lives with his 41-year-old wife and three children the day after being arrested, he told gathered reporters: ‘Obviously I had a very stressful day yesterday - it was a complete surprise. ‘I haven’t really got much very to say in terms of a statement at the moment. I need to go and speak to my lawyer and see where it all stands and just see where we are.’ ‘I’ve got three young children trying to get on with their school life and you have to respect their privacy in all of this. 'It’s nothing to do with them, obviously. It’s to do with me and the serious allegations made against me, and obviously what I want to do is work hard to clear my name. 'As and when I've got more to say I will.’ Officers spent some seven hours questioning the DJ before bailing him. He was suspended from his regular slot at Magic FM as a result, with the station eager to allow him 'to devote his full attention to dealing with these matters. 'All other aspects of his contract will remain unchanged while matters are resolved. 'We can make no further comment at this stage.’ Fox's arrest is not part of Operation Yewtree - the high profile Scotland Yard investigation into alleged sexual offences that was sparked by the Jimmy Savile scandal. Fox (far right) is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. He has also presented a Channel 5 show based on the Top 40 Chart . The former Pop Idol judge, 53, pictured with his wife Vicky, has now been arrested three times over alleged sexual assaults . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

    A gang has been found guilty of ambushing a pair of rival drug dealers and stabbing them to death in a frenzied attack in order to steal their client list. Aaron Carriere, 21, and Josiah Manful, 20, were lured to a quiet residential road in Leytonstone, east London, where they were 'boxed in' by their killers and stabbed 24 times in less than a minute in 'a swift, frenzied and utterly brutal attack'. Six young men and a youth aged 17 were on trial at the Old Bailey accused of the murders which took place in the early hours of Saturday March 1 last year. Aaron Carriere (pictured left) and Josiah Manful (right) were lured to a quiet residential road  where they were 'boxed in' by their killers and stabbed 24 times in less than a minute in 'a frenzied and utterly brutal attack' The ringleader, Devonte Campbell, 20, and two of his co-defendants Casey Jones, 19, and Alex Bernard, 21, told jurors that they had thought they were going to a party at a club but the youth said that was a lie and they were actually planning a show of force in the rival territory. The jury, which began deliberating last Friday, unanimously found Campbell, Jones and Bernard guilty of two counts of murder. Omar Hassan, 21, was found guilty by a majority of 11-1. They will be sentenced at a later date. Opening the murder trial last year, prosecutor Lisa Wilding QC said the two victims were set upon in their black Ford Fiesta in Montague Road having been trapped by four cars which stopped in front and behind so they had no means of escape. She said: 'The occupants of the four cars that boxed in that lone vehicle got out and ran to the trapped car. Inside it were two young men - Josiah Manful and Aaron Carriere. 'Less than a minute later those two men were fatally wounded having been stabbed in a swift, frenzied, utterly brutal attack that left Mr Manful with 13 wounds and Mr Carriere with 11.' Mr Manful managed to get out of the driver's seat to call for help but both men were fatally wounded and were pronounced dead at the scene. Omar Hassan (pictured left) 21, and Alex Bernard, 21, (right) were both found guilty of murder . Jurors were told that the defendants had been 'working as a team' to 'lure' the two young men in to a trap and kill them. Although there were drugs and cash in the car, only one item was stolen - Mr Carriere's mobile phone which contained his drug dealing 'client list'. The prosecutor said: 'The ferocity of the attack, which was inflicted upon men who were helpless and trapped in their car seats, by a pack of men who surrounded the car, the use of at least two knives, the stab wounds to the neck and torso that killed them, were all intended to cause at least very serious harm and we say was intended to kill them.' Each of the defendants played their part in the murders, some wielding knives, some lending support through physical intimidating presence, and others acting as getaway drivers, the court heard. Afterwards, some of the defendants tried to evade capture by dumping cars and fleeing the country in the days after the attack, the court heard. Casey Jones, 19, (pictured left) and Devonte Campbell (right) aged 20 were also found guilty of murder . Mr Carriere and Mr Manful's wounds were so horrific they looked like gunshot victims, with one eyewitness likening the attackers to 'a pack of wild animals', the Old Bailey heard. 'Less than a minute later those two men were fatally wounded, having been stabbed in a swift, frenzied utterly brutal attack than left Manful with 13 wounds and Carriere with eleven,' said prosecutor Jacob Hallam. During the attack Carriere managed to answer his phone and gasp 'help me' to an associate who heard the sound of repeated blows. Manful managed to stagger out of the car but collapsed on the bonnet while his friend died in the car. Mr Hallam added: 'The extent of the injuries of the victims was such that it initially looked as though they had both been shot.' Mr Carriere was a 'successful drugs dealer' selling crack cocaine, heroin and cannabis on the streets of Leytonstone and, unbeknown to him, was the subject of an undercover police probe. The Old Bailey (pictured) heard Mr Carriere and Mr Manful's wounds were so horrific they looked like gunshot victims, with one eyewitness likening the attackers to 'a pack of wild animals' On the night he died, he had been dealing drugs and may have been planning to sell more because he had four packages of crack and eight of heroin rolled together and hidden in his underwear as well as £700 cash in his bag. Mr Manful was apparently worried for his safety because at the time of his death he had a lock knife hidden in his boxer shorts, the jury was told. Campbell, Jones, Bernard, and Hassan, all from east London, denied two counts of murder. Wail Alawi, 23, Abraar Amin, 18, and the 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also from east London, were cleared. It can now be reported that Campbell, a known gang member, was serving a suspended jail sentence at the time of the killings. In January last year, he was handed 16 weeks' jail, suspended for 12 months, and disqualified from driving for 18 months for perverting the course of justice, dangerous driving and driving without due care and attention.

    A garbage collector outside Atlanta has been sentenced to 30 days in prison for starting his work too early. Kevin McGill, 48, who works for Waste Management Inc, took a guilty plea deal after violating an ordinance in Sandy Springs, north of Atlanta, that bans collections before 7am. He turned 48 on Friday, but reported to a local jail at 6pm after being allowed to serve his time on the weekends so he can still work collecting wealthy residents' trash so he can support his wife and two children. The bin collector didn't have a lawyer when he was sentenced and has filed a motion to withdraw his plea, McGill's new attorney Kimberly Bandoh told Daily Mail Online. Kevin McGill, 48, will serve 30 days in jail  after pleading guilty to picking up trash in Sandy Springs, Georgia, before 7am . However, the Court Chief Solicitor Bill Riley asked for a 30 day sentence for the offense of picking up trash around 5am in the suburb and the judge granted the stiff penalty. He was sentenced on February 20th at the local courthouse, the running of which has been handed over to private contractors by the city. There were no real negotiations between her client and Mr Riley when he was sentenced, Ms Bandoh told Daily Mail Online, adding that the solicitor had claimed the offense meant 'automatic jail time'. Mr Riley has stood by the request for jail and says that 'fines don't seem to work' and 'The only thing that seems to stop the activity is actually going to jail.' The solicitor said that residents of Sandy Springs, which include business executives for Delta Air Lines and other major companies, begin calling 9-1-1 when they hear early garbage men, according to WSPA. He said it was the right decision to punish McGill, who had only been on the route for three months, rather than his company, which the city has contracted to pick up its residents' trash. Sandy Springs solicitor Bill Riley said that it was the right decision to punish McGill, rather than his company, Waste Management . McGill is now working with lawyer Kimberly Bandon (pictured) and has filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea . The prosecutor said that early garbage collections are a nuisance to residents who want to sleep and that his office had met with Waste Management after previously punishing its employees for violating the ordinance. A representative for the company went to the courthouse with McGill, who expected to be ordered to pay up to a $1000 fine, Ms Bandoh said. Marla Prince, a spokesperson for for the company, told DailyMail Online that 'The incident with WM employee Kevin McGill is very unfortunate and we are currently working with WM Legal Counsel to resolve the situation'. She said she had not heard of a driver going to jail for a similar incident in the firm's South Atlantic area of Georgia and the Carolinas. Ms Prince added that Waste Management, which operates throughout the US and reported $14billion in revenue in 2014, would coordinate with its employee about his work schedule and jail time. Sharon Kraun, a spokesman for Sandy Springs, told Daily Mail Online that McGill's citation stemmed from an incident where his truck had been photographed by a resident. The city had seen a previous case where a garbage man was given jail time several years ago and that while no similar cases had happened since, the collectors had 'fair warning', Ms Kraun said. She said that Waste Management, which had amassed thousands of dollars in fines with the municipality in the last year, suspended McGill for violating its policies before he went to court. Waste Management could not answer questions about McGill's employment history with the company as of Saturday morning and said it was 'currently still investigating all the facts in the case'. Sandy Springs, a suburb that has seen residents such as business executives, Herman Cain and Akon, has contracted out most of its services, including the court system . His lawyer questioned the practice of going after  trash collectors personally. 'He's the employee. He's not the employer. Sentencing him to jail is doing what?' Ms Bandoh said. 'This is the most excessive punishment for an ordinance of this nature I've ever seen,' she said. McGill had never been to jail or even appeared in the court system, and no other charges factored into the judge's decision to give him jail time. He began serving his sentence last weekend for the February 5th citation and will continue losing his free time into the summer. Ms Bandoh said that the sentence was originally for 30 straight days before someone in the court spoke up and said that McGill should continue working and collecting the suburb's trash. 'I just want this to be over with,' McGill said, adding that he finds it hard to sleep in his hot jail cell. The worker was also sentenced to six months of probation, when he will pay fees to Sandy Springs, according to Vice. The suburb has privatized almost all of its city services, including its municipal courts, its communications, parks, economic development and call center operations. Its website states that 'this business model fosters a proactive, responsive and efficient approach to providing city services.' Residents of the area include professional athletes and rapper Akon, according to the New York Times.

    Nigel Farage today claimed mass immigration had left parents too uneasy to let their children play in the street - as he appeared shift Ukip policy by backing a cap on numbers. The Ukip leader used an election campaign launch beneath the White Cliffs of Dover to demand that net migration be cut to 30,000. It comes less than four weeks after he insisted he would not set 'caps or targets' for controlling Britain's borders. Ukip leader Nick Clegg  used an election campaign launch beneath the White Cliffs of Dover to demand that net migration be cut to 30,000 . Ukip claims the current system is 'unsustainable, unethical and unfair' and calls for more high-skilled workers and people from the Commonwealth to be allowed into Britain. The policy depends on Britain leaving the European Union, with polls showing support for staying in is rising. Unveiling a new poster in Kent today, Mr Farage said he wanted immigration reduced to roughly the levels seen between 1950 and 2000. Mr Farage said: ‘I want to live in a community where our kids play football in the streets of an evening and live in a society that is at ease with itself. And I sense over the last decade or more we are not at ease.’ 'If we went to virtually every town up eastern England and spoke to people about how they felt their town or city had changed for the last 10 to 15 years, there is a deep level of discomfort. 'Because if you have immigration at these sort of levels, integration doesn't happen.' David Cameron promised to to cut net migration below 100,000, but latest figures show that in the year to September the number reached almost 300,000. Speaking in the car park of the Coastguard pub in St Margaret's Bay, near Dover, Mr Farage said: 'When Cameron made that promise he was being wilfully dishonest because he knew the truth and I think now the British public five years on know the truth - that you actually cannot have an immigration policy, you can't set targets of any kind at all, you can't attempt to control who comes into Britain, all the while you're members of European Union.' Unveiling a new poster in Kent today, Mr Farage said he wanted immigration reduced to roughly the levels seen between 1950 and 2000 . David Cameron promised to to cut net migration below 100,000, but latest figures show that in the year to September the number reached almost 300,000 . Ukip's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe has repeatedly promised a cap on immigration . Steven Woolfe, September 26: 'Within the points based system Ukip commits to bringing UK net employment migration down to 50,000 people a year' Steven Woolfe, October 23: 'I promised to cap migration to 50,000 a year' Steven Woolfe, February 26: 'We will set a cap on the number of people permitted to work and reside in the UK by introducing a fairer, and more transparent points based system ensuring we get the skilled immigrants we need and in numbers that the economy can manage.' Nigel Farage, March 4 :'I'm not putting caps or targets ... you need to have more flexibility than that.' Nigel Farage March 31: 'A return to normality, a return to about a net 30,000 people a year coming into this country.' Asked what sort of immigration levels he would like to see, Mr Farage said: 'A return to normality, a return to about a net 30,000 people a year coming into this country. 'I'm saying a net level of about 30,000 a year is roughly what we had for 50 years from 1950 almost until the turn of the century. It was a level at which the country was comfortable and that integration was possible and it didn't, crucially, compress the wages, push down the wages of ordinary people.' Ukip's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe had promised a cap, declaring last month: 'We will set a cap on the number of people permitted to work and reside in the UK by introducing a fairer.' At last year's party conference, he announced: 'Ukip commits to bringing UK net employment migration down to 50,000 people a year.' But earlier this month Mr Farage ditched the idea, declaring: 'I'm not putting caps or targets ... you need to have more flexibility than that.' Charlie Elphicke, who is standing for re-election as the Tory MP in Dover, said: 'All we've seen from Ukip on immigration is chaos and confusion: one minute there's a cap, then there's not. Mark Reckless says certain migrants should be repatriated, then Farage says they're welcome to stay. 'The bottom line is that a vote for Ukip puts Ed Miliband one step closer to Downing Street via the back door – and then there will be no action on immigration.' Ukip's first election campaign poster, which featured an image of the White Cliffs with escalators running up them, and the slogan 'Immigration is three times higher than the Tories promised'. Setting out the Ukip policy, Mr Farage claimed that Britain was now a country that was not at ease with itself due to the levels of immigration over the last decade. Mr Farage claimed that Britain was now a country that was not at ease with itself due to the levels of immigration over the last decade . Mr Farage claimed the figure of 30,000 represented a 'return to normality', when net immigration was somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000. But the Ukip leader said that if Britain pulled out of the European Union after a referendum, those levels could be achieved within the next five years. He said: 'We have to have a referendum first. 'If we had a referendum at the end of this year and within two years, all the details (of withdrawing from the EU), I mean it could take a year. 'There is absolutely no reason why midway through this parliament we couldn't return to normality.' But despite highlighting numbers he would like to see, Mr Farage claimed the immigration debate was 'devalued' by mentioning figures and targets. 'It is by putting out figures that this whole debate was devalued five years ago,' he said. He claimed that integration has been made impossible by the numbers coming in as he called for a ban on non-English speakers being allowed into the country. Asked if all immigrants should be able to speak English, he said: 'Yes, I do.

    A member of the Nebraska state legislature has compared police officers to Islamic terrorist group ISIS. State senator Ernie Chambers, a liberal-leaning independent from North Omaha, was speaking in Nebraska's unicameral capitol building when he said, 'My ISIS is the police.' The chamber was discussing a bill that would allow concealed weapons to be carried in bars when Chambers, 77, began talking about police violence and comparing law enforcement to extremists. Scroll down for video . Ernie Chambers, 77, a Democrat from North Omaha, said during a debate about a gun control measure that 'My ISIS are the police' (file photo) The state senator (above, in blue shirt) responded to statements from colleague Tommy Garrett (inset) that residents were afraid of ISIS by criticizing police and comparing them to the terrorist group . Senator Tommy Garrett, a sponsor of the bill, said that the measure was necessary because residents of Nebraska were afraid of terrorist groups, according to The Omaha World Herald. 'Nobody from ISIS ever terrorized us as a people as the police do daily,' Chambers said. 'The police are licensed to kill us,' he said. 'My home is not threatened by ISIS, mine is threatened by the police.' The senator, who is African-American, described instances of seeing police brutality against blacks. Though the liberal legislator said that he was a nonviolent person, he added that he would carry a weapon against police. 'If I carried a gun, I would want to shoot [a police officer] first and then ask questions later like they say the cop ought to do.' Members of the legislature spent hours criticizing the statements this week after they were picked up by conservative talk radio. Chambers caused further controversy when he was speaking about police and said, 'If I carried a gun, I would want to shoot him first and then ask questions later like they say the cop ought to do' (file photo) The legislator has faced numerous calls for an apology or resignation, including from US Representative from Nebraska Jeff Fortenberry (pictured, file photo) State Sen David Schnoor called for Chambers to resign, according to Watchdog.org. Republican legislature member Beau McCoy said he would ask for an apology every day and was later joined in the request . US Representative from Nebraska Jeff Fortenberry called for the legislature to censure Chambers. He said that 'condoning violence against police is reckless and contradicts the sacred duty of a lawmaker to protect society.' Despite widespread condemnation of his statements, Chambers refuses to back away from his remarks. 'I meant what I said and I said what I meant,' he said. 'I’m not going to resign,” he said. 'I’m not going to apologize.' Extra police troopers were stationed at the Nebraska capitol building on Thursday and Friday. Chambers has refused to back down from his statements about police and ISIS and said he would not resign or apologize . Last week's incident was not the first race-related controversy in recent Nebraska politics. Republican Party member Pat McPherson (pictured) was found to have written a blog that called President Obama a 'half-breed' Several other members of the Nebraska legislature said they did not condone their colleague's statements, but said that they would defend his right to free speech. Expelling Chambers for the remainder of the legislative session would require 33 out of 49 votes. He has previously criticized police and made inflammatory speeches during more than four decades serving in the legislature. The senator previously gained national attention n 2007 when he filed a lawsuit against God for natural disasters as a statement against frivolous lawsuits. He is famous within his state for wanting to end mountain lion hunting and writing poems about other political figures while drawing them. Chambers also made headlines earlier this year when he said that all white people were racist in the wake of another race-related scandal in Nebraska politics. around Pat McPherson, a Nebraska Republican Party member.

    A North Carolina man pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six to 10 years in prison on Wednesday for handcuffing an 11-year-old boy by his ankle to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck as punishment. Former Emergency Room nurse Dorian Harper entered the plea to three felonies, including child abuse, assault with a deadly weapon and maiming without malice. His plea came a day after a jury was seated in the case. 'Yes, sir,' Harper, 58, said when the trial judge asked if he was guilty. Dorian Harper (left) pleaded guilty on Wednesday to handcuffing his girlfriend Wanda Larson's (right) foster son, 11, to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck as a punishment . Harper rejected prosecutors' plea deal Monday, saying he wanted the trial to go on. He and his girlfriend, 58-year-old Wanda Larson, were arrested after a sheriff's deputy found the boy in November 2013. 'This is a very serious case, with very serious implications for Mr. Harper,' Judge Brad Long told the jury Tuesday. Larson was the boy's guardian and a Department of Social Services supervisor in Union County. Larson faces similar charges. She has pleaded not guilty. Authorities said they think Harper tied the dead chicken around the boy's neck as punishment for killing one of the chickens on the 5-acre farm where they lived. The indictment against the couple said the boy had been subject to abuse that also included being chained to a piece of railroad track in his room. Harper cut the boy's face with a knife and used an electric wire to burn his face, according to the indictment. The chicken: Dorian Harper is guilty of chaining his 11-year-old foster son to the porch with this chicken tied around his neck as a punishment . It also said the boy once broke his wrist trying to escape. Four other children — ages 7 to 14, all adopted by Larson — were removed from the home after Harper and Larson were arrested. They also had one 20-year-old adopted son. After his arrest,  Harper  lost his job as an emergency room nurse and Larson lost her county job working for social services. After the incident in the 2013, the 20-year-old, who didn't want to be named, said his adopted parents Wanda Larson and Dorian Harper provided a 'loving and caring home' but the boy has severe psychological issues, including a history of being cruel to animals. He said his parents' punishment, though he didn't condone it, was a last ditch attempt to control the child's behavior and protect the rest of the household. Everyone says this is some sweet innocent kid when in actuality, he is not. He has been to counseling, he is on numerous heavy medications, but nothing has worked,' the brother told KHOU in 2013. The brother said he believes the chicken around the neck was supposed to 'shame the child.' 'There has to be something going on, between that child and that chicken,' he said. 'He either, one, didn't feed it and it died, or two, either he was out there harassing the chicken. He may have killed the chicken. This child has been known to be cruel to animals.' He said the controversial discipline was his father's doing, as his mother, who would have put a stop to it, wasn't home at the time. The brother explained the 11-year-old, who had lived at the home since he was six, was a problem child who was underweight because of a health problem, not because he was being mistreated. 'He would sneak out into the garage take raw meat out of the freezer, let it thaw overnight and next day go out there and eat it raw,' the man, who moved out of the home two years ago, when he turned 18, told KHOU. The home: Police and neighbors described the family's home as being covered in feces with such a pungent smell it 'takes your breath away' 'He has severe psychological issues.' 'He was not allowed to carry his own lunch box because would eat what food is in his lunch and then, throw the lunch box away and say he didn't have lunch for the day.' Union County Sheriff deputies plan to interview the other four children to get a clearer view of their living environment. But the brother insisted his parents cared for the children. 'Everyone assumed all five children in the home have been abused, that is not accurate. You ask all four of the children, they will say they lived in a loving and caring home,' he said. The account contradicts claims from the 11-year-old's relatives who say they have tried for years to get DSS to look into the allegations of abuse. Union County Sheriff Animal Services were at the house early this week gathering the property's remaining animals, including an estimated 75 fowl (chicken, ducks, guineas and peacock) three horses, three donkeys, two llamas, eight dogs and a hog. It was revealed the boy was routinely handcuffed to a piece of steel inside the farm house in Union Country by his foster parents, who were preventing him from running away. Police in North Carolina have released more information on the shocking case - including how the smell of the feces-covered house would 'take your breath away' - as neighbors come forward describing how the boy would beg them for food and, at one point, was 'purple with cold' and 'looked pitiful'. Disturbing: Larson, a former child services worker, lived at this property with four adopted children and the 11-year-old who was the only foster child . Another neighbor, who asked not to be named, said a boy appeared on her porch in May 2012 'purple with cold, with no coat, saying he was hungry'. 'When asked, he said he had no mother or father and didn't know where he lived,' she said. The woman brought him inside and fed him a sandwich. 'It didn’t take him 10 seconds to eat it,' she said. He told her he was 10-years-old and that he had slept in her barn, behind her house, the night before. When she told him she would take him home, she said, he answered: 'No. I want to stay here.' Her daughter called 911 and a sheriff's deputy came out, spoke with the boy, made a phone call, then told him she'd take him home. 'He didn't refuse. He just went with her.' The neighbor said the deputy let her know she had returned him to his foster parents and said the man insisted the boy hadn't been missing more than 30 minutes. The neighbor believes it was the Harper-Larson home. 'I know that’s where she took him (although) you can’t see the house from the road.' Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said said the condition of the house was 'terrible'. 'It was filthy, feces on the floor, holes in the wall,' he said. Chance finding: Authorities stumbled across the disturbing situation after a deputy, who was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property, saw the 11-year-old handcuffed to this porch . 'The bathroom, you could see from outside of the hall into the bathroom. Sink was trashed. No running water. The smell took your breath away.' All the children appeared to be suffering from malnutrition and Cathey said that the first thing law enforcement did for them was buy them pizza. Authorities stumbled across the disturbing situation after a deputy, who was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property, saw the 11-year-old handcuffed to the porch. He approached the house and was confronted by Harper. The deputy asked for Harper's identification and an explanation as to why the child was handcuffed to the porch. According to WBTV, one of the children opened the front door, releasing several large dogs who attacked the deputy. By the time he had the dogs under control, Harper had removed the child from the porch and left the dead chicken on a barrel in front of the house. Other officers arrived and following a search of the house, a criminal investigation was opened. 'It's just shocking,' Captain Ronnie Whitaker said on Saturday. 'It's just disturbing that anyone would treat a child in such a manner.'

Good deed: The first responders (pictured) finished the job for Mr Dabrowski - who had a heart attack on his roof - so the family would not be worried about their home's structural integrity . Fire Chief David Billings told Daily News: 'Quite often a situation like this leaves first responders frustrated and feeling somewhat helpless. They felt going back and finishing the job would at least have a positive outcome for the family. 'They just wanted to do something for the family so when they got home they wouldn't have to worry about the integrity of the house.' The emergency services used a ladder to reach the collapsed man on the roof but failed to revive him, Billings added. The father of three was brought back down and taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. A few hours after being contacted, a dozen members of the rescue service and police department returned to his home and finish Mr Dabrowski's shoveling duties in his memory. And Dabrowski's wife Teresa told the Hartford Courant the family was touched by their efforts, saying: 'He would be very appreciative that someone was looking out for his family. We are all grateful to them.' Even though it deviates from their usual job description, Billings said the responders like doing something to comfort a bereaved family during such terrible moments. He said: 'I certainly support them doing that. I was proud of their actions.' First responders: Mr Dabrowski's widow Teresa said he would appreciate that someone was 'looking out for his family'

    Leeds United delivered a masterclass in smash and grab football as they were battered by Fulham but stole away from Craven Cottage with a resounding 3-0 victory. The game marked five years to the day Fulham beat Juventus 4-1 in the Europa League, arguably the greatest night in the club’s history. But defeat  left them only six points clear of relegation to League One. Sam Byram leaps highest to send Leeds United into the lead against Fulham at Craven Cottage . Byram beats his man as the Yorkshire side take the lead against Fulham in west London . Fulham: Bettinelli, Richards, Hutchinson, Turner, Stafylidis, Parker, Hoogland, Tunnicliffe, Ruiz (Kacaniklic 63), McCormack (Fofana 83), Smith. Subs Not Used: Kiraly, Bodurov, Woodrow, Rodallega, Kavanagh. Sent Off: Stafylidis (52). Booked: Stafylidis. Leeds: Silvestri, Wootton, Bamba, Bellusci, Berardi, Cook, Murphy, Byram, Mowatt (Antenucci 83), Charlie Taylor, Sharp (Morison 67). Subs Not Used: Cani, Stuart Taylor, Doukara, Cooper, Sloth. Booked: Sharp,Bamba. Goals: Byram 40,Bamba 48,Antenucci 88. Att: 19,200 . Ref: Chris Kavanagh (Lancashire). Manager Kit Symons, who was a coach at Fulham in 2010 in that memorable night, was aware of the anniversary. ‘That’s football,’ was all he could summon about their fall, adding: ‘We had 27 shots altogether, I’m incredibly frustrated. ‘I thought we were excellent first half, created numerous chances and didn't take them. I’ve been in and around football for a long time, often there’s sucker punch if you don't take chances. ‘We need three wins to stay up, it’s down to us to go get them. We probably had enough chances to win three games here.’ Twice the home side’s defence fell apart either side of half-time to allow Sam Byram and Sol Bamba to head Leeds ahead. Fulham went down to 10 men and still managed to outplay their opponents, until substitute Mirco Antenucci made it three late on. It was inexplicable that Fulham were not in front before Leeds took the lead, five minutes before the break. Ross McCormack and Matt Smith, facing their former club, raced through early on but could not convert. Bryan Ruiz almost caught out Leeds goalkeeper Marco Silvestri with a 35-yard lob, but he tipped over, then hit the crossbar from a corner. But out of nowhere, Leeds scored when Gaetano Berardi crossed for Byram to head in completely unmarked and by seven minutes into the second half the home team completely capitulated. On 48 minutes Leeds went two ahead, an Alex Mowatt corner bouncing all the way through Fulham’s box to allow defender Bamba to head in at the back post. Then left-back Konstantinos Stafylidis was sent off for two yellow cards within 45 seconds of each other to end any hope of a comeback. Sol Bamba doubles the travelling side's lead as he heads past Marcus Bettinelli in the Fulham goal . Leeds United's Bamba celebrates scoring his side's second goal of the game with teammate Billy Sharp . Symons said: ’It was ridiculous getting the second so soon after the first. He dived in right in front of the Leeds fans for the second. It seemed the ref was moving on, but someone was in his ear then he changed his mind and went for the second yellow. It was rash and petulant.’ Fulham continued to dominate, despite having a man less, until the 88th minute when Antenucci scored with a first-time shot. Leeds manager Neil Redfearn said: ’Our lot got a bollocking at half time, I thought we were off the pace. We worked it out and toughed it out. It could’ve been four or five by the end.’ Kostas Stafylidis of Fulham is sent off for a second yellow card offence by referee Chris Kavangh . Stafylidis walks to an early bath following his dismissal as Fulham failed to impress at Craven Cottage . Mirco Antenucci  celebrates as he scores Leeds' third goal during the Sky Bet Championship match . Antenucci is joined by his teammates as they celebrate an impressive win at Craven Cottage . Ross McCormack applauds the Leeds United fans who applaud him for his time at the Yorkshire club .

Summary target: 
    Sam Byram opened the scoring for Leeds five minutes before the break .
Sol Bamba doubled the advantage with 48 minutes gone at Craven Cottage .
Hosts had Kostas Stafylidis sent off for two second-half yellow cards .

Sam Byram scored twice as Leeds United took the lead with a header from Crach Cottage - not enough to secure relegation if they were at fault despite their defeat vs Liverpool 1-0 2-1. The home side are now six points clear of defending champions Albernislav Stafylidis after 2-0 defeat by Manchester City.

    A while ago, I visited a Hampshire nursery which raises more than four million orchids a year. It was like a slow-motion factory; tissue-cultured plantlets came in at one end, flowering specimens trundled out of the other, each in a posh ceramic pot. Orchids, particularly Phalaenopsis (moth orchids), have become Britain's favourite houseplant but most die within weeks. That should not happen. Moth orchids are easier to nurture than indoor cyclamen or poinsettias and, with care, they can flourish for years. But it helps to know a little about this weird plant group and to understand its special needs. Hardy beauty: Moth orchids (pictured) need gentle treatment to produce glorious blossoms . More than 22,000 species of orchids make up Orchidaceae, the world's largest flowering plant family. About 50 are native to Britain, and the common spotted orchid grows in my own tiny flower meadow. With such a huge range of habitats, orchids' needs differ widely. But once you learn the likes and dislikes of popular houseplant orchids, it's not hard to keep them happy. KNOW THEIR NEEDS . Phalaenopsis, like many cultivated orchids are epiphytes, meaning that they grow in bark crevices in forest trees. They subsist on rain or mist, and nourishment comes from debris lodging in the tree bark, so their sparse roots are as important for clinging on as for absorbing nutrients. In a pot in your house, the orchid needs to think it is in a tropical forest. That means a minimum 16 degrees Celsius ambience, humidity and good light. To boost humidity in spring and summer spray rainwater on to the leaves from an atomiser (if possible always use rainwater warmed to room temperature). In winter, move your orchid closer to an east or west-facing window and the extra light will encourage flowering. The commonest cause of death is overwatering. To avoid that, imagine the orchid perched up a tree, soaked by rain from time to time but drying out in between. Cram the roots into wet compost and it will die. That is why it is best to grow epiphytes in slatted containers or transparent, perforated orchid pots and to allow the prehensile roots to poke into the air. During the growing season, feed monthly with special orchid feed. But in winter, reduce watering and do not feed. HANDS-ON MANAGEMENT . Phalaenopsis should last for about three months but, when they fade, you can persuade the old stem to sprout again. Feel it carefully for swellings (nodes) near the base. They are dormant buds. If you cut the stem just above the second node from the base, a new flower spike should develop. Repot your orchid only if it has become pot-bound or has been in the same compost for more than two years. Do that when the pale roots develop green tips; a sign the plant is ready to repot. Use special epiphytic orchid compost — it will appear coarse and lumpy and is available at good garden centres. Remove any dead or shrivelled roots, shorten the remaining healthy ones to about 12cm and replant the orchid in the same size pot. Pack the compost in firmly for stability and allow any upward-facing roots to grow out over the container's sides. Water thoroughly, making sure all the compost is moist and that the water drains away easily. Next year, when the repotting has worked and you are flush with success, start looking for different orchids. The number of new varieties introduced each year beggars belief. Happy hunting.

Summary target: 
    Orchids have become Britain's favourite house plant but die within weeks .
Moth orchids are easier to nurture and can flourish for years .
With more than 22,000 species, orchids' needs differ widely .

    Chinese tourists have been told to stay off commuter trains that run between central Paris and France’s largest international airport following a rash of robberies this year. The Chinese embassy in Paris issued the rare travel warning this week, saying that it is following up on the cases with investigators. Instead of taking RER trains the embassy is urging Chinese visitors to use buses, taxis or ‘other transport’ to travel between Paris’ tourist zone and Charles de Gaulle Airport north-east of the city centre. Chinese tourists have been told to avoid the RER B train between central Paris and Charles de Gaulle Airport . According to the embassy at least four robberies have occurred on RER B trains – which run almost 24 hours a day with frequent departures – since mid-February, the Hong Kong newspaper The Standard reported. It said one tourist missed a flight home to China after his or her bag was stolen during the 40-minute train ride. In other incidents, a young Chinese visitor suffered ‘a very huge loss’, and two tourists missed their flights home after they had property stolen. Working as individuals or in groups, thieves have been targeting holidaymakers on trains and using distraction thefts. China's embassy in Paris said at least four tourists have been robbed on RER trains since mid-February . In some cases one of the thieves will drop coins or other objects and the helpful holidaymaker has his or her property stolen while they help to pick them up. Some victims have had their bags snatched moments before the train’s doors close. Miramar Travel general manager Alex Lee Chun-ting told The Standard that tours to France and the rest of Europe remain ‘incredibly popular’ and thefts are nothing new. He said: ‘These types of thefts have been occurring for the past few years, but the Chinese government has only just decided to issue a travel warning.’ Thefts on the RER train system are not just limited to tourists, however. Late last year Paris police reported an eight per cent drop in muggings against tourists . According to The Local, the RER service has a reputation for being a crime hotspot, with a gang of about 20 thieves robbing numerous passengers in a planned attack last Sunday. It led to opposition politicians calling for heightened security measures at RER stations, including more CCTV. Late last year Paris police announced that they had seen an eight per cent drop in the number of muggings involving tourists. The French capital once said that it would bring in police from China to support a crime crackdown and assist Chinese tourists, but the plan has been put on hold.

Summary target: 
    Chinese embassy in Paris took the rare step of warning holidaymakers .
It said four Chinese visitors have been robbed since mid-February .

    Chinese embassy in Paris issued rare travel warning this week. It said it is following up on the cases with investigators, but not buses - or taxi transports – robberies a year ago and abroad if they aren't armed.

    Rugby union has a well-worn reputation for being the game of the elite and now we have the indisputable proof, that you indeed need to spend flash dollars to watch the rah-rahs best in action. In a Daily Mail Australia investigation into the cost of taking a family to the football, the Queensland Reds' Super Rugby games at Suncorp Stadium came in a long last, costing about $90 more than the best value - the Western Sydney Wanderers at Pirtek Stadium. With family budgets on a tighter rein than ever before, the challenge is where to best spend your sporting dollar. And judging by the secrets kept by some stadia and their teams, you get the distinct impression they don't really want you to know. So we decided to put them to the test and try and settle the argument, once and for all, by piecing together a direct comparison of a day (or night) out, for a family of four, to the home ground of the top two supported teams in each code. Winners are grinners. Asian champions Western Sydney Wanderers have played before packed houses at Pirtek Stadium for the past two years but while they are testing their fans' resolve this season in the A League they can still boast that they are looking after their loyal followers when it comes to pricing . The Rabbitohs, with almost 32,000 members to their name, kick off their title defence in the NRL on Thursday against rugby league's other best supported club, the Brisbane Broncos but both fall just short in the pricing against AFL's best supported club Collingwood . The Magpies playing at both the MCG and Etihad provide good value for a family of fans, particularly after the home of AFL announced it would cut the cost of food and beverages. Collingwood can boast the biggest following of any Australian football club with almost 70,000 members . The Queensland Reds have one of the largest membership bases with 28,000 now signed up. While Suncorp Stadium is considered among the best to watch football in Australia following the Super Rugby does not come cheap, ranking last in the Daily Mail's assessment in value for money . Rugby League launches into action tonight with the premiers South Sydney tackling the Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium, considered by many the premier sporting venue in Queensland. But does it stack up against Victoria's home of AFL, the MCG? Or what about the tight-knit groups at Pirtek Stadium which back Asian Champions League winners, Western Sydney Wanderers or AAMI Park's A League toppers, Melbourne Victory. It was on the following criteria; a family ticket in general admission (2 adults and 2 children), with the purchase of two meat pies, two hot dogs and two buckets of chips plus one beer, one soft drink and two bottles of water, as well as two supporter caps. Clubs, governing bodies, trusts and stadiums were invited to provide the relevant information. And the winner is: Western Sydney Wanderers at Pirtek Stadium in Parramatta. The Asian Champions League title-holders provide their 17,000 (capped) devoted followers with great value at $147.80. Such was the push for membership that officials had to restrict the number in line with the capacity at Pirtek and the club placed more than a thousand hopefuls on a waiting list. 1. Western Sydney Wanderers at Pirtek Stadium Parramatta $147.80 . 2. Collingwood Magpies at Melbourne Cricket Ground $155.10 . 3. South Sydney Rabbitohs at ANZ Stadium Homebush Bay $163.50 . 4. Adelaide Crows at Adelaide Oval $178.78 . 5. Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium $202.80 . 6. Queensland Reds at Suncorp Stadium $236.04 . *Based on prices from clubs, stadiums and governing bodies . Sometimes it's the little things, as Pirtek catering officials were quick to point out, that their meat pies and chips all come with sauce included in the price. The MCG was fast out of the blocks, this week, ahead of the AFL bounce, touting a drop in prices for a pie at the footy, a move which was widely acclaimed by supporters. A game at 'the G', watching Collingwood do battle against Essendon on Anzac Day, for instance, will set you back just $155.10 for a family outing. Souths at ANZ Stadium and the Crows at Adelaide Oval come in 3rd and 4th. Suncorp Stadium is arguably the best venue in Australia to watch the footy but unfortunately what is beyond reasonable doubt, is that you pay for the privilege, as can be seen by the price of a Broncos game $202.80. The Reds confirm it by taking out the value wooden spoon, by far the most expensive at $236.04. There's no argument that the matter of pricing in the competitive Australian market has become an increasingly thorny issue. While some happily revealed the costs, others were not so forthcoming. Of those who were requested the information, the South Sydney Rabbitohs and Queensland Reds were fastest to act, providing all the details requested within in a relatively short period of time. So too, the Wanderers and Broncos. But others were not so forthcoming, preferring to completely sidestep the issue, including the NSW Waratahs. The Super Rugby champions simply referred DMA to their website and Ticketek for details of pricing. Their home ground of Allianz Stadium, run by the SCG Trust, refused to reveal what they charge for a meat pie and beer. Perhaps worse, the Adelaide Crows did not reply to repeated requests for the figures, even over a 48-hour period. However, in stark contrast, Adelaide Oval officials, provided a quick and detailed summary and also highlighted the added extras of an event at the revamped home of South Australian sport, including the ability for supporters to take their own 'packed lunch and thermos'. More reason to cheer their team. Western Sydney Wanderers fans get the best deal when it comes to supporting a football club in Australia. They topped the ranks in Daily Mail's value for money investigation . The heat is on. While Suncorp and the Reds offered up all details, Allianz Stadium, which is home to Super Rugby champions the NSW Waratahs, chose not to reveal any details of how much it costs for food and drink at a big game . A WSW home game at Pirtek ranks among the most enjoyable for football fans in Australia, its atmosphere rivalled now by its value for money for loyal supporters . And Adelaide Oval is also one of few where boutique beers are available to punters in the general admission areas. On the same day the NRL season was to kick off and with ANZ Stadium playing host to both last year's grand finalists - the Rabbitohs and Bulldogs, officials there said there was no information on pricing which could be provided, only a week out from hosting their first league game of 2015. Melbourne Victory was also unable to provide a breakdown. The pressure has been turned up on all codes as a result of the new deal struck by the Melbourne Cricket Club with its catering contractor. They've reduced the price of a range of products on sale at the stadium in a bid to make going to the football and cricket more family-friendly. In all, eight items have been reduced with bottled water undergoing the biggest price drop from $5 to $3 - that's a discount of about 40 per cent. Suncorp also plays host to the Brisbane Broncos in the NRL. The cost of a family going to watch Queensland's most successful rugby league club is about $202 . MCC chief executive Stephen Gough estimated the price restructure will cost the MCC about $14 million in lost revenue over the course of the seven-year contract. 'We've listened to the fans,' Gough said. 'We understand their affordability concerns and we are very confident that this initiative will be extremely well received.' AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan called on venues around the country to follow the MCG's lead. 'They've made a big statement,' McLachlan said. 'They're leading the agenda now on this issue. Hopefully it's a great outcome for all of our fans across Australia because I think they've put a position out there that people are going to have to respond to.' Etihad Stadium is still negotiating with the AFL on prices but venue management hopes to make an announcement on food pricing before the start of the season. The Adelaide Crows huddle before a match at the Adelaide Oval - where entry conditions are quite relaxed including being able to bring a thermos and packed lunch to the big game .

Summary target: 
    Western Sydney Wanderers are Asian champions and also best on ground when it comes to fans' value for money .
Super Rugby is the most expensive with a day out to watch Queensland Reds at Suncorp getting the wooden spoon for costs .
A decision by the MCG to cut the price of food and drinks means a Collingwood game at the home of AFL is good value for a family .
The price pressures are telling with some clubs and stadiums refusing to reveal the costs of catering .
The most relaxed venue is Adelaide Oval where they let you take in a packed lunch and even a thermos .
Most of the major venues stock only mid-strength standard beers for those in general admission .

Summarized text: 
    The Queensland Reds' Super Rugby games at Suncorp Stadium cost $90 more than the best value. The Western Sydney Wanderers are playing at Pirtek Stadium for the past two years in Australia a week ago, but they haven’t been to the test - and their team is weighing up on the table if it comes down to pricing costs of food and beverages. The Rabbitoh club also has one year of membership bases with almost 32,000 members including an Australian family.

    Cola-Cola has gotten rid of a Fanta advertisement that referred to the 1940s, the time period in which the drink was first produced in Germany, as 'the good old times.' The advertisement, which was broadcast in German, was in honor of Fanta's 75th anniversary and promoted a new drink recipe. The clip detailed how Fanta was created by the soda company's employees, because there were limited supplies available to produce Coke. Scroll down for video . Creation: Fanta was first created in Germany, when there were limited supplies available for producing Coke . The advertisement's voice-over narration said in German '75 years ago, resources for our beloved Coke in Germany were scarce. 'Employees at Coca-Cola - rather clever brainiacs - had to think of something and came up with a brilliant idea. 'From the scarcely available ingredients, such as whey and apple fibers, they simply developed a new drink.' Later on in the clip, the narrator said 'This German soda turns 75 years old.' 'And to celebrate this, we are bringing back the feeling of the "Good Old Times" with the new Fanta Classic.' The advertisement does not say that the drink was produced in Nazi Germany during WWII, the Express pointed out, when there were trade embargoes against the country. According to the newspaper, the advertisement enraged online commenters, one of whom reportedly said they were 'Speechless.' A Coca-Cola spokeswoman issued a statement to Daily Mail Online, which read 'We apologize for any offense caused by a video promoting our new Fanta Classic product in Germany. 'The new product is based on the original Fanta formula and the video was intended to evoke positive memories of many consumers over more than seven decades of Fanta brand history. 'Fanta was invented in Germany during the Second World War but the 75-year-old brand had no association with Hitler or the Nazi Party.' New edition: The advertisement, broadcast in German, commemorated Fanta's 75th anniversary and promoted a new drink recipe .

Jessica Ritchie and real-life partner Jeronimo Garcia perform high-intensity tricks in cirque shows across the world and a currently performing across Australia in Le Noir . The pair had been dating for two years when the strain of not seeing each other for six months at a time became too much. 'We basically started to see each other and after that one thing led to another, but we had that lovely big ocean between us,' Jessica told Daily Mail Australia. While they were luckily based on the same cruise ship several times together, they repeatedly had to go their separate ways with different contracts.

    A University of Southern California chief has vowed to carry out his own investigation into claims  the son of Empire star Taraji P. Henson was 'racially profiled' on campus. The school's Public Safety director, John Thomas, said he was 'disturbed' by reports the actress's son Marcel had been stopped by police on campus for having his hands in his pockets. It comes after Henson revealed she had now decided to send the 20-year-old to historically black Howard University. Scroll down for video . Taraji P. Henson says her son Marcel was racially profiled by police at University of Southern California. The mother and son are pictured above at a film screening in Hollywood last April . Empire star Henson, 44, says her son was stopped at University of California (file picture) for having his hands in his pockets . In an interview with Uptown magazine, she said her son was racially profiled elsewhere in California beforehand and did 'exactly everything the cops told him to do, including letting them illegally search his car. 'It was bogus because they didn’t give him the ticket for what he was pulled over for,' she said. 'Then he’s at University of Southern California, the school that I was going to transfer him to, when police stopped him for having his hands in his pockets.' After learning of the USC allegation, John Thomas revealed that he too had experienced racial profiling as a teenager . In a statement, he said: 'I was deeply disturbed to read news reports about a prospective student who felt profiled on or near campus because of his race. 'We encourage reporting of allegations of bias and I hope for the opportunity to have a conversation with the young man and his mother. Henson has revealed she has now decided to send her 20-year-old son Marcel to historically-black college . 'I would like to look into this matter further and better understand who was involved and what took place. 'As someone who personally experienced racial profiling as a teenager, I have a stake in learning more about this incident and doing all I can to reach a just resolution.' He said he was not yet clear on which police departments were involved and that 'any allegation of bias or unequal treatment by university officers would trigger an investigation that I would supervise along with the university's Office of Equity and Diversity'. He continued: 'It is my expectation and that of the university that our department uphold the highest standards of constitutional policing, affording equal rights and respect to all persons.' Marcel is Henson's only child, and his father was her high school sweetheart. New hit: Henson currently stars on Fox drama Empire as Cookie Lyon, the recently-released-from-prison ex-wife of a music mogul (played by Terrence Howard) After revealing her son's ordeal, the 44-year-old said in the interview: 'So guess where he’s going? Howard University. I’m not paying $50K so I can’t sleep at night wondering is this the night my son is getting racially profiled on campus. Also in the interview, Henson spoke about how happy she was to be one of now many black women leads on the small screen in shows like Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder. 'It feels good that there’s not just one black person. I don’t like that we get fixated on one or two at a time, or three at a time. If you look at Caucasian Hollywood, every year there’s a handful of new faces you’ve never seen before, then after that, they got five movies coming out and they’re introducing you to more talent. So I’m just so happy to see what’s happening on television right now. We have options and that’s how it should be,' Henson said. Proud mother: Henson and her son pictured on January 20, 2013 - attending a celebration for leading women in Washington, DC . Empire aired it's two-hour first-season finale last week, and has already been green-lighted for a second season. Henson plays Cookie Lyon on the show, the ex-wife of a rap music mogul (played by Terrence Howard) who was recently released from prison after taking the fall for his drug-dealing business. The show has had several guest starts in the music industry including Snoop Dog, Courtney Love, Rita Ora, and Jennifer Hudson.

The brigade are based in the Idlib Province in north-west Syria, which has come under sustained attack from the government's forces during the long-running civil war. Last week, Syrian activists and the Western-backed opposition accused the government of carrying out a devastating chlorine gas attack against a rebel-held town in Idlib that killed at least six people and left dozens, including children, choking and gasping for breath. The reported use of poison gas on the town of Sarmin was the first alleged chemical attack since the U.N. Security Council approved a  resolution  that condemns the use of toxic chemicals such as chlorine in Syria. But a Syrian military official in Damascus denied any government role in the attack and blamed it on rebels, adding: 'The army did not and will never use any internationally-prohibited weapon.' Prepared: The rebels are seen here preparing a range of devices to fire at President Bashar Al-Assad's . Simple: Gas canisters are converted into basic shells and loaded to be fired by mortars . Fighters: The Suqour al-Sham Brigade  are believed to be a mix of military defectors and civilian volunteers . Bombs: A man inspects gas canister devices that have been prepared to fired against government forces . Secure: The rebel fighters have built their weapons factories deep inside caves in the Idlib Province . Yesterday, two car bombs killed at least 25 people and wounded another 80 celebrating the new year festival of Nowruz in the mainly Kurdish city of Hassaka in northeastern Syria, according to state media. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights group, which tracks the four-year-old Syrian civil war, said 33 people, including children, were killed in the attack which it said was carried out by Islamic State.

Summary target: 
    Suqour al-Sham Brigade manufacture their own weapons in caves .
Rebel fighters have set up  factories to fight government regime .
Pictures show men preparing shells and mortars in basic conditions .
More than 200,000 estimated dead in last four years of civil war .

    Suqour al-Sham Brigade are believed to be a mix of military defectors and civilian volunteers. They are working in caves to make shells, rocket bombings and shells 'from gas canisters or guns' The rebels are preparing weapons factories as they battle the regime for their own weaponry if they are equipped with weapons factory based in Idlib Province – north west Syria!

    A 22-year-old man bought a coin that he believes could date back more than 2,000 years for just £29. Coin collector Stephen Creswell snapped up what he thinks is a half shekel from Tyre - which dates back to 126BC - at an auction in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire. The coins are believed by Biblical scholars to have been the same as those used to pay Judas Iscariot his 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus. Lost treasure? The coin found by Stephen Creswell, 22, which he believes to be half a shekel from Tyre . Collector: Mr Creswell, pictured, bought the coin for just £29 at an auction in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire . But one expert claims the coin is unlikely to be an original and believes Mr Cresswell might have a 'mock up'. The battered coin weighs 7.7grams, half of a full shekel's weight. The earliest reference of the coin comes in 126BC and it is understood that they remained in circulation. Shekels were used for temple tax in ancient Jerusalem due to their relatively higher concentration of silver than other Roman coins. In Matthew 27:3 it is said: 'Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders...' In some translations of the bible, the word 'silver' is replaced with 'shekels'. Mr Creswell, from Dudley, West Midlands said that he bought the coin as part of a selection but quickly realised he had 'something special'. He said: 'As soon as I saw how old it was I knew I had something special on my hands. I had no idea what it was though until I typed it in to the search engine. 'I'm not really a coin collector, but I just love to grab a bargain.' But after looking at images of the coin, one expert said he does not believe it to be a shekel as Mr Cresswell had hoped. Payment: The coins are believed by Biblical scholars to have been the same as those used to pay Judas Iscariot his 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus, illustrated in this image above . Professional numismatist Mike Vosper told MailOnline: 'I can confirm that this is not even a coin but either a contemporary forgery, although this is doubtful, or more like a modern mock up of a "coin" believed to be some kind of shekel.' Mr Vosper, who runs Mike R Vosper Coins with his partner Viv, said it was the fabric of the coin and the fact that it has half its surface missing that gives it away. Viv added: 'Some coins have surface deposits but nothing like that'. Mr Vosper added that coins such as that is not likely to be found in the UK. The coin, if real, could fetch up to £500 if it was to be sold. Mr Creswell has no intention of selling it on as it reminds me of playing with artifacts when he was younger. He said: 'We had these old coins lying around when I was a kid. They always fascinated me because of the places they have travelled and the hands they could have passed through.' Mr Cresswell started attending auctions as a teenager and said he loved their competitive nature. He said: 'Bidding against other people is part way between placing a bet and taking part in a competition. 'I hate leaving any auction empty handed. My home is full of quirky objects that I've picked up along the way. Without doubt, the half shekel is my favourite so far.'

Summary target: 
    Collector Stephen Creswell, 22, bought the coin at auction for just £29 .
He believes it is half a shekel from Tyre which dates back to 126BC .
Coins were used to pay tax in ancient Jerusalem and are cited in the bible .
But coin expert said its appearance means it is unlikely to be an original .

    Usually when President Obama steps out on St Patrick's day, it's his brilliant green tie which steals the show. But today another accessory won the day - the enormous new 'smart watch' festooning the Commander-in-Chief's wrist. Obama was seen today wearing the hefty item - a Fitbit Surge device - as he walked around D.C. and met with Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, and later lunched with congressmen on Capitol Hill. Scroll down for video . New accessory: Obama sported the watch at a meeting today with Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland . Check it: Obama has recently said that he was considering getting a Fitbit, or its rival the Apple watch . Device: The Fitbit Surge, pictured above in publicity photos, monitors heart rate, sleep and even the location of those that wear it . The Fitbit surge is an advanced piece of wearable technology that constantly monitors the body of the person wearing it. It uses LED sensors to measure heart rate, and can function as a calorie counter and GPS device. It also tells the time. The Surge model is the largest and most sophisticated Fitbit model, and sells for around $250. Obama has previous expressed his interest in emergent 'wearable' technology. In a February interview with Re/code, he seemed torn between getting a Fitbit and an Apple watch. Testing it out: Obama . Suiting up: Obama was pictured earlier today with the watch while getting dressed . He said: 'I don’t have a Fitbit yet, but I work out hard. Word is these Apple Watches might be a good companion for my workouts. So I’m gonna see, I’m gonna test it out.' The testing had evidently begun by Tuesday, when Obama prominently wore the device for his public engagements. Fitbit enthusiasts are encouraged to even wear their device to sleep, where it collects data while the subject is unconscious, and can wake them up with silent, vibrating alarms. One feature the President may be particularly keen on is that the device is programmable to have a golf mode. Fitbits are set up to communicate with mobile devices regularly to store the data they collect - however the President is only allowed a Blackberry because of security concerns, which is incompatible with his new toy. Both the White House and Fitbit have yet to respond to requests for comment.

Summary target: 
    President wore $250 body-monitoring device around Washington, D.C.

    David Walliams has reportedly 'split' from his model wife Lara Stone. According to The Sun newspaper, the 43-year-old comedian and his 31-year-old model spouse - the mother of his son Alfred, two, have agreed on a trial separation. The publication reports that Lara left their London home on Tuesday night, leaving David 'devastated' - adding that he is determined to win her back. A representative for David Walliams declined to comment and MailOnline has also contacted a spokesperson for Lara Stone. Lara, who is 12 years David's junior, took Alfred and the couple's dog Bert with her when she left their North London home. Scroll down for video . Split? The Sun newspaper reports that David Walliams and his wife Lara Stone (pictured in what is believed to be their second last public appearance together at Elton John's December 2014 wedding) have split after less than five years of marriage . Is this the end? David's wife reportedly left their North London home on Tuesday night leaving him 'devastated' A source close to the comedian said: 'David has been putting on a brave face. But people close to him are very worried because they know he's devastated. In fact, David tweeted that it was business as usual for him on Wednesday. He wrote: 'The #WalliamsWhirlwind helicopter tour of schools for @WorldBookDayUK tomorrow will go ahead as planned so not to disappoint my young fans.' Lara and David have a reported wealth of almost £19million - David has a  net worth of £16.3million and Lara £2.6million. News of their split has come as a huge surprise to friends despite the fact they have barely been seen together over the past six months. David and Lara attended Elton John's wedding to David Furnish together on December  21 and two days later watched the London production of Edwards Scissorhands together, which was the last time they were seen out in public together. The insider told the newspaper that his friends are shocked by the split as they thought the marriage was strong - but friends are hoping they will get back together. The source said: 'David hopes it is a blip and that they can get the marriage back on track somehow, especially seeing as there is a child involved.' The way they were: The couple, who wed in May 2010, have a two-year-old son, Alfred together . Putting on a brave face: David tweeted that it was business as usual for him on Wednesday, in spite of the sudden split . Lara's last tweet was on Monday, when she posted something about work. She wrote: '#BTS for lorealparisofficial #Elvive #fibralogy #shampoo #XLhair #worthit #LorealParis.' The alleged split has happened almost five years after they tied the knot. David and Lara began dating in September 2009 after David took her to a Chelsea football match - with the funnyman later filling her home with flowers. Their relationship began after Lara's now-beaten battle with alcoholism following a stint in rehab in 2009. Serious: It has been claimed Lara took Alfred and the couple's dog Bert (who they jokingly refer to as their other child ) with her when she left their North London home . High hopes: The couple (pictured in May 2013) may have reportedly split but David is said to be already plotting to get Lara back . She's gone! According to The Sun, Lara took Alfred and the couple's dog Bert with them when she left their North London home . Lara told Dutch Vogue she was 'very nervous' on their first date but soon knew they shared a 'very mean sense of humour'. She told the publication: 'I’d forgotten to thank him for dinner so I sent him a text. You know what he wrote back? "Who’s this?" 'I was shocked. I really thought he’d forgotten already. I only realised later he was joking. We have so much fun. I’m quite lucky.' David proposed in Los Angeles in 2010, before marrying at London's exclusive Claridges Hotel in May 2010 - with Lara wearing a £30,000 lace and satin dress. Lara told the Daily Star shortly after the wedding: 'I am madly in love. I’ve never been happier. Happier times: David and Lara began dating in September 2009 before marrying at London's exclusive Claridge's Hotel in May 2010 . 'We met at a party and then went on a few dates. He’s wonderful. He’s amazing. He makes me laugh. He’s a proper gentleman. He’s a bit mean but in a good way. I’m happy.' David also seemed blissfully happy, telling The Sun: 'It’s a lovely thing to fall in love, to come back and feel like you’ve got a home. 'I would be at work filming and my wife would be saying, "What time are you home because I want to know what time to put the shepherd’s pie on?" I never thought I’d have that. An international supermodel who can make a great shepherd’s pie.' He also said: 'If you are with someone you adore, you’re happy to just spend time together. You don’t have to be doing something really exciting all the time. We love watching X Factor. 'If she’s away I have to wait until she’s back before I can watch it, which is a shame because I already know who has been kicked out. But we love it.'

The couple announced that Lara was pregnant in November 2012 and David gushed about how happy he was about becoming a father. 'I'm really looking forward to being a dad, the whole experience,' he told the Daily Mirror. 'I'm looking forward to seeing the baby for the first time, seeing this little person who's a mixture of you and the person you really love.' The couple welcomed baby Alfred in May 2013 with David announcing Lara's pregnancy on his Twitter page. He wrote: 'Some wonderful news. My beautiful wife Lara is pregnant. We are having a baby! It is due next year and we both couldn't be happier. Dx.' Lara told Dutch Vogue last year that she was rather content, saying: 'I’m blessed; I have a fantastic husband, a beautiful baby, a wonderful dog and super job. Life’s pretty good and normal.' In August 2013, David admitted he could easily fall for either a man or a woman, as he's of the opinion that 'things can change for people over the years' when it comes to their sexual preferences. The comedian opened up about his sexuality in a revealing  interview with Radio Times magazine, explaining that to him, love is about falling for someone's 'soul, heart and brain', rather than whether they're male or female. The news of the split comes after it was recently claimed that the blonde beauty had declined Justin Bieber's request to go on a date while shooting their most recent ad campaign for Calvin Klein. A source previously said: 'While they were doing the whole Calvin Klein ad, Justin was very forward and asked Lara on a date. He made it look like a joke at first, but then tried to put in the charm. 'It didn't work though as she respectfully declined since she is married. Surprisingly, it didn't get awkward and the shoot went on with out incident.' Walliams is previously said to have dated Lisa Snowdon and Geri Halliwell.

    Chelsea are considering a renewed bid to sign Raphael Varane from Real Madrid this summer. Jose Mourinho is a confirmed admirer of the France international centre-back and is willing to test Real Madrid's resolve to hold onto the 21-year-old. Jose Mourinho feels Chelsea need a commanding centre-half like Raphael Varane . Varane is valued at £40million by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez and was signed after being persuaded by Zinedine Zidane that Madrid was where his future lay. However, Varane has grown frustrated this year with Carlo Ancelotti preferring Pepe and Sergio Ramos as his centre-back pairing when fit. Manchester United are also keeping tabs on Varane after losing out to Real Madrid in 2011. Real Madrid have slapped a £40m price tag on French defender Varane . Age: 21 . Appearances: Lens 23/Goals 2; . Real Madrid 76 (20)/5; France 17/1 . Varane has been labelled Real Madrid's Lion and former France defender Frank Leboeuf believes he has the potential to be better than Real Madrid legend Fernando Hierro . Varane signed a new six-year contract at the start of the season . The 21-year-old has grown frustrated with Carlo Ancelotti preferring Pepe and Sergio Ramos as his centre-back pairing when fit . Sir Alex Ferguson was keen to sign him from Lens and the Old Trafford club will challenge for his signature again should Madrid show a willingness to deal. Mourinho has concerns about the centre of his defence. Gary Cahill has sometimes looked uneasy against European opposition while John Terry is 34. Kurt Zouma has done well this season but is still inexperienced and Varane is already an assured performer at international level. Chelsea captain Terry will be given a new one year contract while Branislav Ivanovic, who is 31, has 16 months left on contract. The Blues also have Andreas Christensen and Tomas Kalas in reserve but both lack big game experience. Jose Mourinho has concerns over John Terry and Gary Cahill in the centre of his defence .

    Once he had come round after emergency surgery, Ben Morgan asked the surgeon two pressing questions; would he ever play again and if so, could he make it back in time for the World Cup? Mercifully for the Gloucester and England No 8 – who had shattered his leg in a match against Saracens the previous night – the answer to both was 'yes'. But that was just the theory; the practice involves relentless determination and dedication, including endless hours in a hyperbaric chamber, where the 26-year-old is mastering the art of sketching while wearing an oxygen mask. No stone is left unturned in Morgan's quest to regain full fitness in time to be part of the national squad for the global gathering in September and October. There are no guarantees he will be ready, but despite the magnitude of his injury, the signs are good and he is infused with optimism. Ben Morgan is undergoing sessions in a hyperbaric chamber to speed up his recovery from a fractured leg . Morgan has been out of action since he injured his leg playing against Saracens in January . Morgan was named England's player of the series following his superb displays during the November Tests . He simply has to take part in the tournament, and help the hosts excel, because the final takes place on his mother's birthday and she would like her son to mark it in style! On January 9, Morgan was driving for the line during an Aviva Premiership match at Kingsholm when his season was crudely terminated. He heard the sounds of breaking bone, and when team-mates and opponents moved sharply away as he lay on the ground, he knew he was in real trouble. 'All I remember was that we had a scrum in the left-hand corner, I picked up the ball and went on a usual run,' he told Sportsmail. 'I got tackled by Jacques Burger and having looked back at the clips, I was able to see he wrapped his legs around my leg and I didn't really have anywhere to go. 'At the time, I didn't really know what the hell had happened and I just started yelping. I like to think I wouldn't make those noises unless it was serious! People moved out of the way pretty quickly and even though I wasn't in that much pain, I knew I had done something. Gloucester No 8 Morgan lines up London Welsh fly half Olly Barkley at the Kassam Stadium . 'I just didn't know how bad it was going to be, but I had an immediate realisation that I was going to be out for a while. When I got to the hospital, the staff were pretty guarded, but I got more of a sense of how bad things were when a few hours had passed.' A surgeon from Cheltenham came to the hospital in Gloucester to perform the operation during the night and when the anaesthetic wore off, Morgan sought to put his mind at rest about his predicament. 'When I'd come round, I fired loads of questions at the surgeon,' he said. 'The first thing was 'Is it a career-ender?'. I knew he couldn't be precise, but I needed a ball-park idea of how long I'd be out for and he told me six months.' The damaged leg contained a significant amount of precious metal; to help the healing process. He will have another operation next month to replace a pin with more flexible wire, but a plate will remain in place. Morgan has not yet had a chance to set off airport scanners, but he quipped: 'I'm made of Meccano – don't put any magnets near me!' Morgan is brought to ground by flanker Marcell Coetzee during England's loss to South Africa in November . His self-deprecating humour is part of a philosophical attitude towards the situation he is in. While a home World Cup would be a momentous career highlight, he refuses to agonise about whether his recovery happens fast enough, despite moving heaven and earth to make sure it does. A six-month rehabilitation period would mean Morgan is match-fit by July 10 and wouldn't need to miss any of the training camp which starts just before that red-letter date. But he said: 'If it takes longer, that's just how it is. 'The World Cup is the carrot, but I have to be realistic; if I don't make it, I don't make it. I'm not going to tear myself up about it. I'm doing everything I can to get back for it, but there are certain hurdles I have to clear. I'm quite relaxed about it. I'm pretty sure I'll be back. If I do end up going into the World Cup training camp, I'll be fresh. I'll be blowing out of my a**e, but I'll be fresh!' The recovery programme has conventional elements, with Morgan spending seven weeks in a cast and following up that initial stage with physiotherapy and weight-training at the club. But he is also employing cutting-edge methods to help his leg mend rapidly. Twice a day, four times a week, he spends 90 minutes in a hyperbaric chamber at an MS centre in Gloucester. Morgan makes another powerful ball carry against the Wallabies at Twickenham in November . 'The bulk of what I'm doing is oxygen therapy,' he said. 'I'm being pressurised, to simulate being 10 metres below sea level, and I'm breathing pure oxygen. The thinking is that it increases the red blood cells in your blood, which is brilliant for healing. 'I go in the morning, then go to train with Gloucester, get physio and do upper-body weights, then go back to the oxygen chamber. I'm in there for an hour-and-a-half.' To pass the time, Morgan's creative side is emerging, as he is filling up a large sketch-book with pencil drawings. The subjects are wide-ranging. Billy Vunipola regained the  No 8 jersey in Morgan's absence and has started all three Six Nations games . 'I've drawn a few pictures; my dog, my nephew, a little Mickey Mouse, a turtle, a light-bulb,' he said. 'There's also a little lizard, a Ninja Turtle, an owl… I've just ordered some sketching pencils because it's difficult to get good shading with the ones I've been using. I'm stepping it up! 'I did a couple of bits and pieces at school. It's just a bit of fun, a way of passing the time. I'd be bored out of my brain if I wasn't doing something like the sketching.' Morgan was on a roll before his horror injury. He was named England's Player of the Series after the autumn campaign and had usurped Billy Vunipola to reclaim the No 8 shirt before his barnstorming progress was abruptly halted. In recent weeks, instead of being at the heart of the national team's RBS Six Nations campaign, he has been an observer. He will be at Twickenham next Saturday to watch against and is aiming to spend a day at the team hotel, while maintaining contact with the England coaches. Stuart Lancaster will dearly hope to have Morgan involved at the World Cup and the long-term casualty is confident he will be ready. Veteran Harlequins back rower Nick Easter has been another player to profit from Morgan's absence . He said: 'I feel really positive and, hopefully, that positive attitude will help my healing process. Some people get dragged down with really dark thoughts, but I'm staying upbeat. 'Getting back in time is the hardest battle, but then I have to get selected again, which is going to be a very tough task. Nick Easter has done well since coming back in, Billy is playing well too and I'm missing a block of games. Luckily, I ended on a bit of a high, but I'll have had six months out of rugby. Whether that is a good thing, because I'll be fresh, or will count against me, I don't know, but I'll do everything in my power to be there.' If he makes it, he will have a sketch-book full of souvenirs from his rehabilitation – and a chance to give his mum the ultimate birthday present.

    Jonathan Davies is determined to prove Wales’ doubters wrong in the final weekend of the RBS 6 Nations and plans to celebrate the championship with a plastic cup after a silverware snub. With trophies being sent to Twickenham and Murrayfield, Wales will return home from Rome empty handed even if they go on to win the three-horse race for the title. Warren Gatland’s side need a thumping victory over Italy to overturn their points deficit on England and Ireland and — despite the Kiwi keeping his counsel about the scenario — there is understood to be some disappointment about the organisers’ trophy decision. Wales centre Jonathan Davies is tackled by Ireland lock Paul O'Connell (left) and tighthead Mike Ross . ‘I’m sure we’ll find a trophy somewhere, like a plastic cup or something,’ said Davies. ‘Obviously people are doubting us and they don’t think we’re going to be involved. But we just worry about ourselves, concentrate on ourselves, and will put a performance together that hopefully means we can get the cup on Sunday.’ Welsh hopes of a landslide victory could hinge on the fitness of Italy No 8 Sergio Parisse, who has a ‘30-40 per cent chance’ of being fit. Italy have delayed their team announcement by 24 hours to give him time to recover, but Davies says Wales will not change their approach even if the 31-year-old is ruled out. Scott Williams is congratulated by Davies and Dan Biggar following his crucial try against Ireland . ‘We can’t fall into that trap,’ said Davies. ‘If you do, the pressure seems to come on you rather than the opposition. ‘Italy have some key injuries with the captain maybe being out, and after the disappointment of France, they’ll have doubt in their minds. ‘It’s about us going out there and stamping our authority. It’s about sealing that doubt and building from there.’ While Italy are struggling for form, Wales are still building momentum after their victory over Ireland. A fine defensive display kept the championship race alive, however Davies knows his side must add more cutting edge in attack. Warren Gatland's side are in a three-horse race for the Six Nations title that will be decided on Saturday . ‘Looking back on the Ireland game, we probably left two or three scoring opportunities out there,’ said Davies. ‘This week we’re going to have to take all our chances. ‘As a back line we haven’t fired as we’d have wanted to. The forwards have worked tirelessly all campaign for us and there’s pressure on the backs now to take opportunities.’ If Wales can rack up the points, the pressure will move on to Ireland and England, who are up second and third against Scotland and France in the afternoon of staggered fixtures. Davies and his countrymen will watch events unfold from Rome and he plans to cheer on his French clubmates from Clermont Auvergne. Italy's captain and talisman Sergio Parisse faces a race to fit for the visit of Wales on Saturday . ‘France can be amazing at times,’ said Davies. ‘Hopefully, they can turn up and do a job. They’ve done it in the past.’ Aside from two injury-enforced changes in the front row, Gatland has kept faith with the starting XV who beat Ireland. Scott Williams scored the decisive try and the centre was on Wednesday among the latest batch of players — along with Alun-Wyn Jones, Dan Lydiate and Gareth Anscombe — to sign a dual contract with the WRU and their region. ‘Alun-Wyn, Dan, Scott and Gareth represent a cross-section of experience. Each one of them is a player of proven talent,’ said Gatland.

Summary target: 
    Wales are in a three-horse race for the Six Nations title along with Ireland and England ahead of the final round of action on Saturday .
Warren Gatland's side need a thumping victory over the Azzurri to overturn their points deficit on England and Ireland .
Italy No 8 Sergio Parisse has a '30-40 per cent chance' of being fit .

    Jonathan Davies is determined to prove Wales' doubters wrong in the final weekend of RBS 6 Nations. The Welsh side are in a three-horse race for the Six Nation title if they win on Saturday despite their points deficit v Ireland and Italy – but they will not change that approach unless it happens!

    Mike Brown has spoken for the first time about ‘one of the worst experiences of my life’ — missing out on a precious England cap. The 29-year-old full-back returns against Scotand on Saturday, a month after being knocked unconscious 12 minutes into England’s victory over Italy. Brown missed the defeat by Ireland after experiencing headaches while attempting to complete strict return-to-play protocols. Mike Brown is ready to return to England's starting XV after missing the Ireland defeat two weeks ago . Brown was knocked unconscious just 12 minutes into the win over Italy and was ruled out for two weeks . The England full back was treated on the pitch but could not continue as Stuart Lancaster's side won 47-17 . After agonising about owning up to his symptoms, knowing it would see him miss the trip to Dublin, he reluctantly alerted team doctors about his concussion. ‘Pulling out is one of the worst things I’ve ever had to go through in my whole life,’ Brown said. ‘As a sportsman everything you work towards is pulling on your country’s jersey and representing everyone in the country. ‘I went to see the doctor about 8.30 in the morning — I usually get up about 7.30 to 8 — and during that time I was sat in my room thinking should I try the next stage, should I carry on? I’ve trained through headaches before so I could definitely have trained on and seen how it went. Brown is back in training and ready to play against Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday . Brown is supporting the RFU's latest concussion awareness initiative after missing the Ireland game . ‘But it wouldn’t have been good preparation for the team or me having that in the back of my mind. And obviously there’s the serious implications of the dangers and the risks involved. ‘The way I am, stubborn, desperate to play for my country, I probably would have (hidden symptoms in the past). But we’re all aware of it now and the example has been set by the England medical team and the coaching staff here for everyone else to see.’ Brown, who wins his 36th cap on Saturday, watched England’s defeat at home with his fiancee Eliza. ‘I was fuming, he said. ‘I wasn’t happy at all. Unfortunately, my fiancee had to go through it with me, poor lady. It wasn’t something I want to be doing too regularly, sat in my lounge, on the edge of my sofa, screaming at the TV!’ The England star admitted it was a bitter blow to be absent for the game in Dublin, but he had to be honest .

    'The Ripper': Duwayne Henry, pictured, was jailed for life at Blackfriars Crown Court yesterday . A serial rapist who called himself 'the Ripper' was caught after he attacked a woman in a home-made 'torture chamber'. Duwayne Henry selected his victims using an online escort agency and lured them to his flat in Hackney, east London, where they were threatened with knives and repeatedly raped. Police found a knives, a circular saw and a hedge trimmer laid out on the floor of his bedroom when they searched his home. Officers believe he intended to use these weapons on his final victim, but was interrupted by a passer-by who heard her screams. The mystery hero has never been identified. Henry was jailed for life with a minimum sentence of 12 and a half years at Blackfriars Crown Court yesterday. The 34-year-old targeted at least three prostitutes during his 14-month spree, believing their trade meant they were less likely to report his crimes, police said. In the first known assault, which took place in early 2013, Henry repeatedly raped his victim in a brutal three-hour attack before taking a photo of the woman's driving licence. He told her he would use the details to find her and kill her if she went to the police. In the second known attack, in April 2013, Henry gagged the victim with duct-tape before and raped her at knife-point. He then forced her to wash his bedsheets before raping her again on the floor. His final attack took place in February 2014, when Henry booked an escort to meet him outside the flats where he lived. He held a knife to his victim's eye and led her to his bedroom, described by police as a 'torture chamber', where he had laid out a circular saw, seven knives and a hedge trimmer. One of these items was plugged into the mains. As soon as she entered the room, Henry held a knife to the woman's eye. He pushed her over and told her she was going to die. The woman was gagged, tied up, and raped. The rapist was interrupted when a man, alerted by the woman's screams, appeared in the doorway of Henry's bedroom. He untied the woman, who phoned the police. 'Torture chamber': Henry selected his victims using an online escort agency before luring them to his flat in Hackney, east London, pictured. There, the women were threatened, tied up and repeatedly raped . The victim later told officers that Henry threatened her and said: 'I'm invisible, I'm the Ripper'. Officers from the Metropolitan Police found one victim's phone in his flat and managed to track down a second victim. The mystery 'good Samaritan' has never been identified, despite a police appeal last year. Detective Inspector Tony Lynes said: 'Henry's attacks were thoroughly planned. 'He controlled the environment where the attacks took place, avoiding the risk of being disturbed. 'Luckily he did not take into account the courage of his victims or the tenacity of the detectives investigating this case and I am pleased that today he can look forward to a substantial prison sentence. 'The crimes Henry has been convicted of today are appalling but I can't be certain that there aren't more victims out there.' On sentencing, the Judge John Hillen said: 'You are a serial rapist. The terror you instilled in your victims, by use of weapons and words used and restraints do not bear imagining. 'Your crimes are at the highest end of wickedness and are disturbing for the public. 'You present a danger to women and present a significant risk of serious harm to the public.'

    A Dutch mother has abducted two of her four children and taken them to join militants fighting for the Islamic State terrorist organisation in Syria. The unnamed 32-year-old  Chechen national had been living in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands before taking her young son and daughter to ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa. The father of the missing children named the pair as Luca, seven, and his sister Aysha, eight, and said they had been taken without his consent. The woman's two other children are believed to have been handed over to a relative before she left to join the terror group. Abducted: The father of the missing children named the pair as 'Luca', seven, (left) and his sister 'Aysha', eight, (right) and said they had been taken without his consent . The missing woman, who has not yet been named, fled the Netherlands with two of her children last October, the Dutch prosecution's office confirmed this morning. Snatched: Eight-year-old Dutch girl 'Aysha' was abducted by her mother and taken to join ISIS . It is the first known instance of children in the Netherlands being abducted and taken to join ISIS. According to the Dutch newspaper De Limburger, the children's father had previously reported his estranged wife to the police because he was concerned she was planning to travel to Syria. Officers are said to have questioned the woman several times but she denied having intentions to join ISIS and investigators could find no evidence of concrete travel plans. Shortly afterwards the woman vanished from Maastricht with two of the children, prompting Dutch officials to launch a major alert, leading to an international arrest warrant being issued. Despite this the woman later took to Facebook to declare that she and her two children had arrived in the terrorists' de facto capital Raqqa, having used fake passports to travel across Europe. After making the announcement of their arrival in Raqqa on Facebook last October, nothing has been heard from the trio since. Dutch officials said they had no way of telling whether the group were still alive, with prosecutor Bart den Hartigh declaring the recovery of the children 'impossible' as the Netherlands has no legal relationship with either the Syrian regime or the terror group that controls the city of Raqqa. No place for children: The unnamed 32-year-old Chechen national had been living in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands before taking her young son and daughter to ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa (pictured) The news comes as an 18-year-old man has been arrested at his home in Birmingham on suspicion of preparing to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State. West Midland Police have said the teenager, from the Hodge Hill area of Birmingham, was arrested at around 7am today by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. It comes the day after it three British teenage jihadists were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of trying to join Islamic State fighters in Syria, in a dramatic security operation. A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man were intercepted in Istanbul after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group. They dialled 999 and British police quickly tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul. The three were brought back to Britain where they were questioned  on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism.

    Former Liverpool defender John-Arne Riise has picked his #one2eleven of stars he has played alongside throughout his career, on The Fantasy Football Club. It is no surprise that Riise's team is dominated by Liverpool players past and present, as the left back played in the side that won the 2005 Champions League. But World Cup winner and Roma's long-standing captain Francesco Totti gets a worthwhile mention with team-mate Daniele De Rossi, and Fulham's Kieran Richardson also gets a look in too. Watch #one2eleven every Friday evening on The Fantasy Football Club, Sky Sports 1 or catch up On Demand. John-Arne Riise said his former Liverpool team-mate Pepe Reina (centre) was 'always trying to make jokes' GOALKEEPER: Pepe Reina . 'He's the funny one. He's always trying to make jokes and has so much confidence in himself, which to be a goalkeeper you really need to have.' RIGHT-BACK: Steve Finnan . 'The most calm person I've ever seen; never stressed. Not the most defensive right back but I really enjoyed playing with him and never seemed to make any big mistakes.' The quartet of (left to right) Sami Hyypia, Jamie Carragher, Xabi Alonso and Steven Gerrard were all included . DEFENDER: Jamie Carragher . 'I remember one game against Blackburn [in 2003] and he broke his leg. He didn't want to get carried off, he wanted to walk off. He wanted to carry on playing. He's a proper, proper defender. He's an easy choice. Best defender I've ever played with. DEFENDER: Sami Hyypia . 'Great right foot. Great left foot. Good in the air because he's 2 metres tall. Read the game perfectly. One of the nicest guys I've ever met in football.' Ex-Fulham team-mate Kieran Richardson took up a place as left back as Javier Mascherano also featured . LEFT BACK: Kieran Richardson . 'He was a machine. Very quick, strong, powerful, offensive, defensive. Even if you pass him he was so quick at turning he'd catch you up again. He gave me a big fight [for my position].' DEFENSIVE MIDFIELD: Javier Mascherano . 'He's a dog. I know the opposition hated playing him because he's always on your toes and always tackling you.' DEFENSIVE MIDFIELD: Daniele De Rossi . 'Sees openings and passes that maybe not many other players could see. He will go down as one of Roma's greatest players.' Riise (second right) described his 2005 Champions League winning skipper Gerrard as 'the perfect captain' DEFENSIVE MIDFIELD: Xabi Alonso . 'Probably the pass master. Nobody can pass the ball like him. I remember on his debut at Anfield, it probably took him about 39 minutes before he misplaced a pass. Unbelievable player.' MIDFIELD: Steven Gerrard . 'Best player I've played with without a doubt. I'm really privileged to have played with him because Stevie will go down as the greatest of all time. He's an amazing person also and for me he was the perfect captain.' Roma legend Francesco Totti (left) was one of three non-Liverpool players to be named in Riise's dream team . STRIKER: Francesco Totti . 'The God of Rome. I've never seen anything like it. As a football player he's not quick and he's 38-years old now but he has his technique and ambition, and a touch that's God's gift.' STRIKER: Fernando Torres . 'He has got a bit of stick since he left Liverpool and still has to come back to his best form, but while I was there he was a scoring machine. I think the pressure was too much for him at Chelsea. I think it got to him a little bit and it was too much to handle. I think he's back where he belongs [at Atletico Madrid].'

Summary target: 
    John-Arne Riise named his #one2eleven XI on The Fantasy Football Club on Sky Sports .
Eight Liverpool players past and present make the cut in Riise's team .

    Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN)At least six people have died and more than 60 were injured after the roof of a partially built cement factory collapsed Thursday in southwestern Bangladesh, police and fire officials told CNN. Many of those injured were in critical condition, said Mohammed Bakir Hossain, the top government physician of Bagerhat district. Mohammad Niazmur Rahman, the fire and civil defense official coordinating the search and rescue effort, said early Thursday evening that two people had been pulled alive from the rubble and as many as 30 others are believed to be still trapped. Deputy inspector general of police of Khulna range SM Monir Uz Zaman said the number of those still trapped was unclear "as we're not sure how many people were working inside." The collapse took place around 1 p.m. (3 a.m. ET) in Mongla, a port city in the Asian nation's Bagerhat District. The factory is owned by Sena Kalyan Sangstha, a welfare organization for former Bangladeshi troops and their beneficiaries, according to Rahman and other local officials. Video from Boishakhi TV showed medical workers tending to the injured as they were wheeled into a local medical facility caked in dust. Deadly incidents at factories and other buildings, sadly, are nothing new in Bangladesh. The worst happened on April 24, 2013, when a nine-story building that housed five garment factories collapsed. Rescuers managed to save the lives of more than 2,400 people, but more than 1,100 died in the horrific accident. And a November 2012 apparel factory fire on Dhaka's outskirts killed at least 117 people, some of whom jumped from the building to escape the flames. Most of the dead were women, almost half of them burned so badly that DNA tests were needed to identify them. That blaze led to the convictions of 13 people for gross negligence of safety measures and spurred widespread criticism about the state of workers' rights in Bangladesh. The government responded by revamping laws so that workers no longer need approval from employers to form trade unions, and every factory that sells within the country also has to pledge 5% of their profits toward a workers' welfare fund. The government also boosted minimum wages from $38 to around $68 per month. Yet this hasn't stopped more deadly incidents, including the January deaths of at least 13 people when a fire broke out inside a Dhaka factory. Farid Ahmed reported from Dhaka and Harmeet Shah Singh from New Delhi. Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Sugam Pokharel and Kunal Sehgal contributed to this report.

Summary target: 
    More than 60 are injured, many critically, official says .
The cement factory was owned by a Bangladeshi army welfare organization .
In recent years, Bangladesh has had other deadly incidents at factories .

    A woman who spent eight years desperately searching for her mother has finally found her after a selfie of her wearing a large 'Find My Mum’ message board went viral on Facebook. Stacey Lee had become separated from Brenda Drake in 1993 when she was just two years old after a family breakdown and she went to live with her father and two brothers. Aged 15, the schoolgirl desperately wanted to find her mother and began trawling through the electoral roll, Facebook and the internet in a bid to find her. Scroll down for video . Stacey Lee decided to make a last ditch bid to find her mother by posting this picture on Facebook . At long last: An emotional 23-year-old Stacey hugs her mother Brenda for the first time in 21 years . After eight years of being met with dead ends, 23-year-old Stacey was resigned to the fact that she would never see her mother again. However, Stacey's boyfriend, 22-year-old Martin Smith, encouraged her to create a message board made out of cardboard with her mother’s name on it along with details such as her birth date and the hospital where she was born. Stacey's friend then took a photograph of her holding the message board and posted it to her Facebook page sparking the image to be shared more than 100,000 times. Within 20 hours, Stacey had a call from a woman who said she might be her cousin and put her in touch with 46-year-old Brenda on the social media network. The Facebook messages which will lead to mother and daughter being reunited at last . Later the pair were reunited during a tearful meeting at a pub near Brenda's home in Blackpool, Lancashire. ‘When I clicked on my mum’s Facebook profile I couldn’t believe it – she looked just like me!’ said Stacey, who lives in Chorley. ‘I sent her a message and told her that I had missed her and that I wanted to build a relationship with her. ‘She sent me her phone number and I called her. I was shaking as I dialled the number and I just sat staring at the phone for 15 minutes before I made the call. ‘Mum told me that she had four other children and that she had always thought about me and my older brothers. A teary-eyed Stacey is reunited with her mother, Brenda, and meets sister Shannon, for the first time . ‘We cried together on the phone. It was very emotional and I was so happy that I had finally found her. ‘I arranged to go and meet my mum the following day in Blackpool. My arms felt like jelly for the whole journey. ‘I went to meet her in a pub and when I saw her I just hugged her and we both cried. We were in shock. It was very emotional. We look a lot like each other and I am quite shy and quiet like her.’ Stacey said she had never seen a photograph of her mother, and although she knew her name was Brenda Elizabeth Davies and that she had been born in Leyland, she didn’t know her age. ‘Growing up I had always wondered about my mum,’ said Stacey. ‘I was born in Manchester but when I was two I went to go and live with my dad, David, then two years later I moved to Runcorn to live with my granddad and two brothers. 'As I approached my teenage years, I always thought about my mum. Martin Smith came up with the idea for Stacey to post the photograph on Facebook which was shared 100,000 times and help reunite mother and daughter in just 20 hours . 'My friends had good relationships with their mums and I often wondered what it would be like to have a mother-daughter relationship. 'Occasions like Mother’s Day and Christmas Day were particularly difficult and when I reached the age of 16 I started looking for my mum on Facebook and the electoral roll. 'When I first met my partner, Martin, five years ago, I confided in him about my long-lost mother and he was so supportive. He's been my rock. 'There were times when I thought I would never be reunited with my mum. She could have passed away or moved abroad for all I knew. 'Last week Martin and I were talking about my mum again and he encouraged me to create a sandwich board and use it to look for her on Facebook. 'I had seen similar posts on social media and I just thought "why not?" I had nothing to lose. 'I wrote my birth date and the hospital I was born in along with my mum’s full name and birth place. 'I knew my mum might have changed her name since I was born but it was worth a shot.' Ten hours after posting the picture to her Facebook profile, the image had been shared 100,000 times, and the next day Stacey was contacted by Kerianne Davies, a friend she had known in her teenage years. Stacey said: 'I received a Facebook message from a girl I had known when I was younger. She told me that she had some information about my mum, and that she was my cousin. I was so confused, but it turned out that her father was my mum’s brother. 'I used to go round to Kerianne’s house a lot when I was a teenager, so it turned out that I had known my uncle all along! Lots to talk about: Stacey and sister Shannon share details of their lives after growing up apart . 'It was unbelievable, I couldn’t believe that I had known some of my relatives. Kerianne had the same surname as my mum’s maiden name but we never put two-and-two together because Davies is quite a common surname.' Stacey was told her mother had changed her surname and after a quick search, found her mother’s Facebook page and sent her a message. Within an hour Brenda had replied and the pair exchanged phone numbers. Brenda explained that she had changed her surname to Drake after getting married, and had moved to Blackpool soon after she had been separated from Stacey and her brothers Stuart, now 26, and Steven, now 25. She went on to have four more children, Shannon, 19, Shona, 15, Aaron, nine, and Sabrina, eight. Stacey kisses Martin who she has described as 'her rock' throughout her search . Brenda said she was delighted to finally have been able to see Stacey again and had also searched for her and her two sons. 'I regret losing contact with my three eldest children,' said Brenda. 'I thought about them a lot, especially at times like Christmas. 'I tried looking for them but I always came to a dead end. I always thought that they would come looking for me when they turned 16 but I never heard anything from them. 'When I received the Facebook message from Stacey, I just couldn’t believe it. 'She was so beautiful and I just couldn’t wait to meet her. 'Stacey is so sweet and adorable and my other children were so pleased to find out they had an older sister. 'We're all looking forward to the future and I am going to be reunited with my two sons Stuart and Steven too.'

    For once the north London spotlight didn't fall on Arsenal this Sunday afternoon. After the week they've had, Arsene Wenger would have been happy to shun the limelight this time. Ask Gunners fans prior to kick-off if they'd rather three points or a Spurs loss in the Capital One Cup final and you'd have been greeted with split responses. Olivier Giroud connects with a corner to fire Arsenal in front in the first half as they continue their bid for a top-four finish . Giroud watches as the ball heads for goal as Arsenal take the lead against Everton who were suffering from their European exertions . Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard can only stand and watch, along with the rest of his defence, as the ball trundles into the net . Giroud, content that the ball will cross the line, turns away to celebrate as Howard makes a late but unsuccessful attempt to stop it . In the end, as arch-rivals Tottenham prepared for their date with destiny at Wembley, the Gunners got their win, courtesy of goals from Olivier Giroud and Tomas Rosicky, to move four points behind second-placed Manchester City. But much like their demoralising Champions League loss to Monaco on Wednesday night, this didn't make for comfortable viewing. The 2-0 scoreline doesn't tell the full story. Everton dominated large spells of this clash - the Emirates Stadium a bag or nerves until Rosicky's last minute goal. Nevertheless, while their participation in this year's Champions League is under huge threat, their qualification for next year's competition is firmly on course thanks to this win. Wenger rang the changes following Wednesday's hugely disappointing loss. Vice captain Per Mertesacker and Danny Welbeck were axed following the loss to Monaco and replaced by Gabriel and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. For Gabriel, in particular, it was a huge chance to cement himself in his manager's first-team plans. Mertesacker's role in the starting XI has been called into huge question this season following a string of below-par displays. And it seems Wenger's reached the end of his tether with the German World Cup winner after another disappointing display in midweek. Giroud struggled in Arsenal's midweek defeat by Monaco but showed his delight at the Emirates after firing the Gunners in front . Giroud points to the heavens after scoring (left) and points to his temple as if to urge Arsenal to maintain their concentration . Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Ospina 7.5; Bellerin 7, Gabriel 6.5, Koscielny 6.5, Gibbs 6.5; Coquelin 7 (Chambers 89), Cazorla 7.5; Oxlade-Chamberlain 8 (Rosicky 82), Ozil 6.5, Alexis 6.5 (Welbeck 87); Giroud 7 . Subs not used: Szczesny, Mertesacker, Monreal, Walcott. Goals: Giroud 39, Rosicky 89 . Booked: Giroud, Koscielny . Manager: Arsene Wenger - 7 . Everton (4-3-2-1): Howard 6; Coleman 7, Jagielka 6.5, Stones 6.5, Garbutt 6.5; McCarthy 7, Besic 6.5 (Naismith 77), Barry 6.5 (Gibson 84); Mirallas 6.5 (Lennon 62), Barkley 7; Lukaku. 6.5 . Subs not used: Robles, Kone, Alcaraz, Osman . Manager: Roberto Martinez - 6.5 . MOM: Oxlade-Chamberlain . Ref: Andre Marriner . Att: 59, 925 . Ratings by SAMI MOKBEL at the Emirates . Alexis Sanchez did not manage to get on the scoresheet for Arsenal but the Chilean was his usual busy self, covering the left wing as the Gunners beat Everton. Click here for more pitch maps and stats in our brilliant match zone. Tomas Rosicky had only been on the pitch for a matter of minutes when he fired a deflected effort beyond Howard in the Everton goal . Rosicky was left in acres of space and allowed time to take aim as he made sure the points were staying at the Emirates . Rosicky and GIroud, Arsenal's two goalscorers, celebrate the former's strike in the dying minutes against visiting Everton . A strong display from Gabriel against Romelu Lukaku may have heralded new central defensive partnership - alongside Laurent Koscielny - for the Gunners until at least the end of the season. But the former Villareal defender nearly fluffed his lines on his big audition in the 18th minute as he failed to deal with a long-ball to allow Lukaku a free run a David Ospina. Thankfully for the Brazilian, his fellow South American bailed him out with some excellent goalkeeping. It didn't impress the Gunners fans, nor did it his manager who almost saw his central defensive gamble backfire in woeful fashion. Everton deserved the opening, too, after a confident start at the Emirates. Left-back Luke Garbutt, 21, on only his second Premier League start had made a bright start, while Muhamed Besic and Ross Barkley were seeing plenty of the ball in midfield. Arsenal, on the other hand, started lethargically - lacking any vigour or pace in their play. That was until Giroud missed a guild-edged opportunity to hand Arsenal a 28th-minute advantage. Having brilliantly escaped the attentions of Phil Jagielka deep inside the penalty area, the Frenchman had time to pick his spot from Alexis Sanchez's cross - but the striker sent his close range header wide. It was the last thing Giroud needed after his high-profile misses against Monaco on Wednesday. Supporters didn't get on his back this time, fans responding to by Giroud's wastefulness by chanting his name. Francis Coquelin was forced off after initially clashing heads with a team-mate before being hit on the face with the ball . Coquelin is looked at by medics getting a bloody nose. The Frenchman carried on but was later forced off with a suspected broken nose . His nose already hurt, Coquelin took another hit when the ball smacked him square in the face as he challenged for it . Coquelin's face was left in a mess as his nose bled following the second of two incidents during Arsenal's win over Everton . Wenger probably wouldn't have been quite so understanding on the bench, however, having watched the striker, who he has spoke glowingly of in recent weeks, squander yet another chance. The miss, though, did herald a period of sustained pressure from the home side after their slow start. However, if Gabriel hadn't produced an excellent last-ditch tackle to deny Lukaku in the 38th minute then the growing sense of optimism would have instantly waned. The challenge would have made Gabriel feel an awful lot better after his earlier howler. And his mood would have improved further when the Gunners took the lead just a minute later. So to did Giroud, who put his midweek woes behind him to nip in front of John Stones to flick home Mesut Ozil's corner. It was the perfect response after the barracking from his own fans during the defeat to Monaco. Perhaps it was harsh on Everton after a first-half in which, for the most part, they looked comfortable, if not the better side. Gareth Barry tried, spectacularly, to put the Toffees back on level terms inside five minutes of the restart but sent an acrobatic bicycle kick over the bar. Luke Garbutt attempts to drive down the win but his progress is stalled by the intervention of Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin . Gabriel was handed a start in the heart of Arsenal's defence and he made his presence felt with this challenge on Romelu Lukaku . Giroud puts his head in as Everton defender Phil Jagielka stretches his leg out in an attempt to win the ball as Arsenal push forward . Everton forward Kevin Mirallas then saw a penalty appeal rejected by Andre Marriner, claiming Oxlade-Chamberlain had handled in the box. Much like the first-half, Roberto Martinez's side had made a positive start after the break - Garbutt's delivery from dead-balls causing Arsenal's defence problems. The Everton boss threw on Aaron Lennon in place of Mirallas in search of a leveller. Given his Spurs connections, Lennon was afforded a horrendous ovation from home supporters. There'd have been more boos in the 65th minute had Ospina not tipped over Lukaku's first-time shot from Barkley's cross as Everton continued to make life uncomfortable for their hosts. It was even more uncomfortable for Francis Coquelin who was left with a bloody nose following an accidental collision with team-mate Giroud. He would later be replaced after taking a ball full in the face. Lennon missed a glorious chance to score on his return to the capital, firing straight at Ospina deep inside the area after great work from Seamus Coleman down the right. The Emirates Stadium was a bag of nerves. Ozil should have eased the tension in the 80th minute after being sent through by Oxlade-Chamberlain but the German's shot was blocked by Jagielka. Substitute Rosicky, finally, eased tensions in the 89th minute with a strike from the edge of the area that took a deflection off Jagielka.

    A seven-year-old boy suffered a deep wound above his eye after he was mauled by a Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross he was trying to cuddle. McKinley Worthington was bitten by the dog during a family day out at a pub near his home in Bolton, Greater Manchester last April. CCTV footage shown to Bolton Magistrates' Court shows the schoolboy being licked by the landlady's dog before it turns and bites him as he leans in for a cuddle. Mauled: McKinley Worthington, right with his father, Aaron, was bitten by the dog during a family day out at a pub near his home in Bolton, Greater Manchester last April. Left, the boy was left with a wound above his eye . Family day out: McKinley was with his sister, Maisie and parents Sammi-Jo and Aaron, pictured together . The dog's owner, Margaret Wilson, who runs the Oddfellows Arms in Bolton, Greater Manchester was convicted of having a dog dangerously out of control last week. She was fined £200 and ordered to pay £520 in costs, but her dog, named Caine, will not be destroyed. Instead it must wear a muzzle in public places and in the pub area at all times. McKinley's mother, Sammi-Jo Gledhill, said after the hearing that her son started screaming 'I am going to die' as blood poured from the wound above his eye. He was taken to hospital where he was given eight stitches - leaving him with a scar above his eye. McKinley is now petrified of dogs and tells his mother he looks 'ugly' because of the scarring. He also refuses to leave the house without his cap on. McKinley and his three-year-old sister, Maisie, had been taken to the pub with their mother and father, where the dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback cross, was allowed to walk around freely. Margaret Wilson, pictured last week outside court, was convicted of having a dog dangerously out of control. Right, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier-Rhodesian Ridgeback crossbreed like the one that attacked McKinley . Footage taken from a security camera shows McKinley on his knees trying to get the dog to play with him at around 7pm - seven hours after the family arrived at the pub. Initially the dog is seen licking McKinley's face, but then bites the schoolboy when he leaned in for a cuddle. Witness Trevor Oliphant said: 'When the little lad came in the dog went to his bed. The wee lad went to follow him and I said "I think he is tired". It appeared the dog didn't want to play with him.' Wilson denied wrongdoing claiming the boy's injuries were caused accidentally. McKinley was taken to hospital where he was given eight stitches, leaving him with a scar above his eye . She said her dog had always been allowed downstairs in the pub and had never had a problem with the animal previously. She said she was aware of Miss Gledhill and her children in the pub but 'hadn't felt the need' to take Caine upstairs and 'had no worries about him at all'. She told police that she had earlier told the boy to stop bothering the dog who was 'always downstairs just trotting around, lying down'. She added: 'I allow children in my pub because I have six children of my own and 15 grandchildren. I have always said that other children can come in if they are supervised. 'I have had Christmas and Halloween parties in my pub with 20-plus children with no problem. As an animal he is very laid back. He gets bullied by my cat. 'As a general rule if people say "I'm not playing" he goes away. Mckinley did go up to him a few times. I had asked him to leave the dog alone - he is not a toy.' But Miss Gledhill, who has since been barred from the pub, told the court: 'I had seen McKinley go up to the dog a few times but it doesn't give the dog the right to bite my son. 'There was a big gash to McKinley's eye and around dogs now he is petrified. When he sees his scar he says he looks ugly. He won't leave the house without a cap on. ' After the hearing she added: 'When it happened at first, I thought a pool ball had hit him in his face. It was all a blur but I wasn't drinking. 'The kids were always within eyesight as the pub is open and their dad was there and all our friends. There are loads of kids there. Attack: CCTV footage from The Oddfellows Arms, pictured, shown to Bolton Magistrates' Court, shows the schoolboy being licked by the landlady's dog before it turns and bites him as he leans in for a cuddle . 'When it happened Mckinley kept saying "I'm going to die, I'm going to die". He was braver than I would have been. 'Skin was hanging down and I could see lots of white bits which I guess was his tissue. He was screaming. 'I tried to clean him up and then the ambulance said to put a dry towel on it. In the ambulance I was in shock. He was just covered in blood. 'In hospital the doctor said that if the dog had bitten him a couple of millimetres lower, McKinley could have been blinded. 'He was very lucky. It's heartbreaking when he says he is ugly because of the scars. I feel like crying. 'After it happened we had to get rid of our Jack Russell Rex who was a puppy we'd got at Christmas because McKinley was petrified of dogs. 'Now he is very conscious of his face and he says that his scar can itch and hurt. When I saw the CCTV of the incident I started crying. 'I do understand it is her pet but you don't know with dogs - they can just turn. Another kid could bend down and it could react the same. It could have happened to any kid.' Father Aaron, 32, said: 'I know it's a pub but it's a family pub and there's always lots of kids in there - and I want the dog to be destroyed for what it did to my son. '

    (CNN)On the basketball court, Karl Turk forgets that he walks with a limp and a cane. He'll get so caught up in the moment that he'll gesture with his hands to make a point and his cane will go flying. He's in the zone. Now, the man who was told he might never walk again is coaching his team in the state playoffs. Turk is the head basketball coach at West Oso High School in Corpus Christi, Texas. His team just clinched the district championship after an undefeated district season and are playing in the Texas State Basketball playoffs. It's an impressive run for his first season as head coach -- and an inspiration to his young players. "Coach shows us to never give up on any of your dreams," says 14-year-old starter Creighton Avery, who has known Turk since he was 9. Turk has been obsessed with basketball since he was a boy growing up in Indiana. When he was 5 years old, he learned to read by studying the sports pages with his grandfather. By the time he was 13, he was dreaming of playing for the Indiana Pacers. All that changed on January 21, 1994. That night, the 14-year-old watched the Chicago Bulls beat his Pacers in an intense game. He walked to bed. He woke up paralyzed. He was rushed in an ambulance to the hospital. For two weeks, he was completely paralyzed from the waist down and had temporarily lost some of his eye sight.  After numerous tests, Turk was diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis, a rare disease that causes inflammation of the spinal cord. Turk and his family were facing the harsh truth about what his quality of life would be like. He had to cope with the fact that he may not walk again. "Most patients do not recover well," said Turk. He spent the next 66 days in the hospital. A turning point came when Reggie Miller, the Indiana Pacers' all-star player and Turk's favorite basketballer, heard about what Turk was going through and paid him a visit in the hospital. Miller and Turk spent the next couple hours discussing each of their stories. The basketball player told him about growing up with pronated hips and having to wear leg braces, similar to the ones Turk was wearing at the time. He talked about what it took to be in the NBA: that many good ball players failed to embrace and work on what they were not good at, and personality and character weeded many good players out. "Reggie inspired me and helped me to embrace who I was," Turk said. "For that moment, I felt he believed in me and saw my potential for greatness." It's a message that stuck with him as he entered high school in a wheelchair and began to adjust his dreams. There was hope he could walk on his own again but he would have to have assistance. Turk participated in a rigorous physical therapy regimen and by his senior year he shed his last leg brace and began to walk with a cane, which he continues to walk with today. "I keep that last leg brace today on my desk as a reminder of where I have come from," said Turk. Turk attended Indiana State University, where his dream to play college basketball turned into dreams of wanting to coach. In 2004, he met Coach Ronnie Arrow, the head basketball coach at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, at a summer basketball camp and later worked for Arrow as the school's director of basketball operations. "When you first see him, you may think he can't do what others can," Arrow, now retired, told CNN. "But he gets the job done no matter what." All Turk wanted was to coach his own basketball team. But it wasn't so easy. From 2009 to 2010, he applied for 10 high school head coaching positions and numerous assistant coaching positions. He only received one interview. The forced sabbatical led him to wonder if he really had a future in coaching. "I knew my resume was competitive," he said. "I knew my passion for the game wasn't exceeded by anyone." He began to wonder if "having a cane and an unusual gait" would prevent him from ever coaching. In the two years when he didn't have a team to coach, he studied other coaches' methods and sought their advice on how he could improve. In 2010, he was hired as assistant coach at West Oso. And in 2014, almost 10 years after moving to Corpus Christi, he became the head coach. He has strived to embody the ideals that Reggie Miller imparted to him all those years ago in the hospital. "I want my students to know that I care about them, that I work for and belong to them," said Turk. "So often, it's the messenger more than the message, I want to be the messenger that my students embrace." In his dreams, he can still play basketball. In reality, he has fallen down in practice, and during games. There isn't much room on the sidelines to walk up and down, and he often trips over his athletes' feet. "It hurts me that there are things that I cannot physically demonstrate -- a lot of the footwork stuff with stops, turns and jumps." But his players don't seem to mind. "We don't notice his disability, we see him as a great coach," said starter Creighton Avery. "He is always positive and inspires us."

    On an evening when cross-city rivals Manchester City were sent crashing out of Europe, United record signing Angel di Maria resisted revelling in their exit to take a stroll with wife Jorgelina Cardoso. The reigning Premier League champions failed to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the fourth consecutive season - losing 1-0 to a Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona at the Nou Camp, although without City keeper Joe Hart the scoreline would have been more damaging. Di Maria and his wife have endured a difficult introduction to Manchester after a failed attempt to burgle their home while the family, including young daughter Mia, were inside saw them leave in search of safer accommodation. Angel di Maria and wife Jorgelina Cardoso take a walk around Manchester on Wednesday evening . The Argentina ace would have missed local rivals Manchester City being dumped out of Europe . City failed to reach the Champions League last eight after being beaten by Lionel Messi and Barcelona . Things on the pitch have been equally challenging for the 27-year-old who has struggled for form in recent months and was suspended for United's 3-0 victory over Tottenham on Sunday, where Louis van Gaal's side arguably delivered their best performance of the season. Di Maria will be available for United's eagerly anticipated clash with Liverpool on Sunday as both teams compete for a top-four finish that will bring Champions League football next season. However, former Old Trafford captain Bryan Robson believes the manager faces a decision over whether to bring his £60million record signing straight back into the team. Di Maria had been struggling with a loss of form before being sent off in United's FA Cup defeat by Arsenal . Di Maria missed United's impressive win over Spurs, which included Wayne Rooney's classic goal celebration . Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, he said: 'It is a big call for Louis van Gaal. 'You have to look at the situation. Certain away games are a lot tougher than your home matches. You go for more attacking flair in a home game whilst away you do try and get more of a balance where you have defensive security and then you counter attack. 'Angel has had ups and downs. Like everybody else he has had some periods when he's played really well and then some poor performances. He is no different to anybody else. 'It has taken him time to settle into the English game, getting used to the manager and his formations. Foreign players do need time.

    Lewis Hamilton is determined to' create history' again this Formula One season after insisting there is more to come despite a perfect start to the new year. Reigning world champion Hamilton claimed pole, fastest lap and race win in the opening grand prix of the campaign in Australia earlier this month. With team-mate Nico Rosberg second it was abundantly clear Mercedes will take some stopping again this term following a dominant 2014. Lewis Hamilton poses for a picture with a fan at a meet-and-greet session in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday . Hamilton is expected to go head-to-head with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg once more in 2015 . Hamilton has vowed to create history at Mercedes as he bids to win his third world championship . Mercedes set a new record for victories in a season with 16 from the 19 races, surpassing the prior mark of 15 set by McLaren in 1988 and Ferrari in 2002 and again in 2004. The German manufacturing giant also equalled Red Bull's 2011 record of 18 poles for the year, with their only blip in Austria where both Hamilton and Rosberg made errors to let in Williams' Felipe Massa. The worry for Mercedes' rivals this year is the team appear to have taken a step forward, with Hamilton showing no let up in his desire to make it three world titles. 'In terms of my performance I've got more to come,' said Hamilton ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix. 'I've been spending time with the engineers and I'm going to work really hard to understand. 'Last year when I went to Malaysia I went fresh. It was like my first race of the year. The British driver appeared in relaxed spirits as he sets sights on a third Formula One title . The Mercedes drivers look set to dominate the remainder of the season after setting the pace in Australia . Rosberg and Hamilton sign autographs for the dozens Mercedes-supporting fans in Malaysia . 'I went into the race not really knowing how long the tyres would last, but what happened turned out to be exceptional. 'After that race there was this big debrief and a document done to explain everything I did. 'Now I've won in Australia I'm going to extract everything from my data and see how I can better my performance. I definitely feel in this next race I can be better than I was last time out.' Asked of Hamilton whether it was Mercedes' target to win every race this season, he replied: 'The target's always been to win every race, even in the bad days. 'But this year we have an awesome car with improved reliability, so the target is to create history again.' Hamilton won in Malaysia last year ahead of Mercedes team-mate Rosberg . Hamilton is aware, however, of the potential perils and pitfalls that lie ahead which could scupper such aspirations. 'To pick up where we left off last year was awesome, but if 2014 showed us anything it's that putting together a whole season is never easy,' assessed Hamilton. 'Winning the first race is just one small step in a long journey and I'm not reading anything into it. 'The next step is Malaysia and that's all I've been focusing on since we left Melbourne. 'The race is really tough with the heat and humidity, but I feel ready for anything right now and the aim is to repeat last year's performance. 'It took me eight attempts to win this race before I finally made it to the top step last year. I don't plan on waiting that long again. 'From an outsider's perspective it appeared Hamilton crucially drew first blood in what is expected to be another intense season-long battle with Rosberg. Hamilton, though, suggested otherwise, stating: 'Psychologically it doesn't make any difference for me. 'I won the championship again last year, and I felt like it wasn't a fluke. I'm deserving of where I am. 'And I worked damn hard to get that win in Australia. Again there wasn't any luck involved.'

    An Australian woman has suffered severe frostbite injuries after she got so drunk she fell asleep outside a Canadian bar in the middle of winter. Emma Quirk, who shared photos of her painful injuries onimgur, admits she was 'f***ing stupid' following the drunken incident in December at Prince Albert in Saskatchewan, Canada. Ms Quirk, who lived in NSW's Blue Mountains but moved to Canada four years ago, says she was 'blackout drunk' when she lost her friends and was last seen at a bar about 2.30am. Emma Quirk has revealed her horrific frostbite injuries after she fell asleep outside a bar in Canada for three hours in the middle of winter . She told her friends she was going to have a cigarette before vanishing into the minus 30 degree Celsius temperatures without her jacket and gloves. Ms Quirk was found outside a nursing home curled in a ball trying to sleep  three hours later and her fingers were already notably purple. 'It was 5.45am when I was found. At 6.30 a nurse told me that best case scenario I keep my fingers... worst case I lose my hands,' she said. Emma Quirk (middle), who shared photos of her painful injuries on imgur, was last seen with friends (pictured) inside a bar in December at Prince Albert in Saskatchewan, Canada, before she vanished . She was found outside a nursing home curled in a ball trying to sleep three hours later and her fingers were already notably purple (pictured) Ms Quirk was treated in hospital over several days and said medical staff all wanted to check out her 'sweet blisters' and find out how long an Australian could withstand the cold. Her specialist Dr Randall Friesen - which she claims is a pun for Dr Freezin - told her her fingers would blister and swell before they could be popped a few days later. 'The pain and pressure at this point was verging on unbearable. I was taking opiates the whole time... frostbite recovery is pretty well known for its pain,' she said. 'My next visit with Doc Freezin he was wearing an apron and a face mask with a plastic shield over his head. Emma was treated in hospital over several days and was told her fingers would have to blister and swell before they could be popped . Her specialist Dr Randall Friesen - which she claims is a pun for Dr Freezin - told her her fingers would blister and swell before they could be popped a few days later . 'With my hand over a metal tray, he cut my blisters with a scalpel. Puss went everywhere. I think I even got the hospital curtains.' She said after a few minutes her finger deflated and she was left with raw skin. Her hands are in the process of healing and she can use them again, but her specialist is still concerned about her left pinky and right middle fingertip. 'I won't find out until June. If I lose them I want to make a sweet, custom made prosthetic,' she said. Emma says pus went everywhere when doctors eventually popped the huge blisters leaving her with mounds of extra skin . Her hands are in the process of healing and she can use them again, but her specialist is still concerned about her left pinky and right middle fingertip .

    The implantation of memories is a common feature in sci-fi films, such as Inception and Total Recall. But now, for the first time, conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while they slept. The feat  gives hope that the same technique could one day be used to change human memories, which could help people who replay traumatic events over and over in their minds. For the first time, conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while the sleep. The technique could one day be used to change human memories, such in in films like Total Recall and Inception ( a still from the film is shown) The brain typically replays the day’s activities when people or animals sleep, which allows it to reinforce and learn a new activity, for example. Experts have found that when this replay process is disrupted in rodents, so too is their ability to remember what they learned – for example, a new area that they explored – the previous day, New Scientist reported. Scientists from the Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution in Paris, France, used this replay process to create new memories in the brains of mice, while they slept. The team, led by Karim Benchenane, focused on place cells - which are neurons that fire in response to thinking about, or being in, a specific place – and help animals and humans form internal maps. The brain typically replays the day’s activities when people or animals sleep, which allows it to reinforce and learn a new activity, for example. Scientists used this replay process to create new memories in the brains of mice, while they slept - and say it could one day be used in humans while they sleep (stock image) In the same way that humans sometimes remember things that didn’t actually occur, researchers have found that bees also misremember. It’s the first time that false memories have been observed in non-human animals. Researchers from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) tested to see if bumblebees would confuse merged versions of patterns that had previously rewarded them with food, with the ones they had actually seen. They found that if they’d previously been shown a flower with black rings and then a yellow one, that they would later seek food rewards from a flower with yellow rings on it. This incorrect merging of long-term memories in bumblebees is similar to some types of misremembering information that have previously only been observed in humans. The researchers think that such memory errors are probably common in animals whose lifestyle involves regularly juggling multiple memories. Professor Lars Chittka, from QMUL’s School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, said: ‘That people form false memories is well understood but it has never been seen in other animals before. ‘There are a lot of similarities between our own memories and those of other animals. ‘The more we know about the way that memory works in the animal kingdom the more we’ll be able to understand our own memory and the problems we have with it.’ He monitored the activity of these cells when the mice explored an ‘arena’ using electrodes, isolating the cell that fired in a certain arena location. While the mice slept, they monitored the creature’s brain activity and when the specific place cell fired, an electrode stimulated the brain areas linked to reward. When the mice woke up, they immediately scurried to the location that was linked to the rewarding feeling, showing that a new pleasant memory of the place had been formed by the scientists. While this is the first time a conscious memory has been implanted during sleep, experts have already managed to create subconscious associations in the minds of sleeping people – so that smokers associate cigarettes with the smell of rotten eggs, for example. Experts think that if subconscious learning has been forced on the mice while they slept, they would have explored the area in a more random way, instead of heading straight to the place they associated with reward. ‘The mouse develops a goal-directed behaviour to go towards the place,’ Dr Benchenane said. ‘It proves that it's not an automatic behaviour. What we create is an association between a particular place and a reward that can be consciously accessed by the mouse.’ He thinks it could take years for the technique to be adapted to implant different kinds of memories such as skills, for example, but hopes that it could be developed to alter traumatic memories in people. He believes that positive thoughts could be attached to negative memories to stop people having nightmares or dwelling on upsetting events. ‘If you can identify where in the brain a person is reactivating a phobia-associated experience, you might be able to create a positive association,’ he said. The study was published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.

    Roy Hodgson must convince Saido Berahino that his international future is with England after the forward received an official approach from Burundi. Berahino, who has scored 16 times for West Brom in the Barclays Premier League this season, was called into the England squad for the first time in November. The striker was born in Burundi and a delegation of officials from the tiny country in south-east Africa have been courting him this week. Saido Berahino (left, in action for West Brom against Aston Villa) has impressed England boss Roy Hodgson . Berahino was called in to the senior England squad last November but is also wanted by his native Burundi . Burundi, 126th in the FIFA rankings, play Mauritius in a friendly on March 25 and want to name the West Brom forward in their squad. England’s head coach names his squad on Thursday for the Euro 2016 clash with Lithuania on March 27 at Wembley and the friendly in Turin against Italy four days later. Berahino has yet to represent the England team and he would still be permitted to switch nationalities under FIFA rules. Hodgson’s striking options have been swelled by the return from injury of Daniel Sturridge, along with regular forwards Danny Welbeck and England captain Wayne Rooney. Hodgson has already made it clear that he intends to select Tottenham forward Harry Kane when he names his squad at the national stadium next week. Berahino celebrates scoring for England's U21s but can switch allegiances having not played for the seniors . Berahino trains with the senior England squad in November (left) and in action for the U21s . Kane, who is the Spurs squad travelling to Manchester United on Sunday, has scored 16 times in the Barclays Premier League and was named player of the month for the second time on Friday. His emergence means Hodgson has a dilemma over who to select as his fifth striker. Berahino, an England Under-21 international, was named in the full squad for the first time in November for the clashes with Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier and the friendly with Scotland at Celtic Park.

    Carol Kirkwood, pictured at the Television and Radio Industries Club awards where she was crowned Best Weather Reporter for the seventh time, has been getting explicit pictures in the post . She has just been crowned Best Weather Reporter for the seventh time – so there is no doubt Carol Kirkwood is a hit with viewers. But the 52-year-old BBC Breakfast presenter has revealed some male fans are more than a little enthusiastic and send her explicit pictures in the post. ‘I do get letters from older men, fan mail,’ she said, gesturing to her nether regions. ‘It is terrible. I have had so many over the years. I am almost immune to it. You can tell by the hand writing. ‘I don’t have anyone who checks our mail as it all comes into the office. I don’t count them.’ Her smiley demeanour and shapely figure, which she often dresses in figure-hugging outfits, have attracted an army of admirers. On Tuesday she was given the Weather Reporter gong at the Television and Radio Industries Club (TRIC) Awards for the seventh time, beating off ITV rival Laura Tobin and the BBC’s Tomasz Schafernaker. Speaking at the awards ceremony, the presenter – who also does weather reports for The One Show – said she also receives sordid messages online. ‘You get a lot on social media. If they are on Twitter you block them,’ she said. She explained any explicit pictures sent to the office are quickly ‘binned’. The weather presenter is divorced from Jimmy Kirkwood, her husband of 25 years. But her new partner, whose identity is unknown, takes her legions of male admirers in his stride. She said: ‘My boyfriend is used to it. He just thinks it is funny. He does not take it seriously which is probably just as well.’ The broadcaster herself has taken a light-hearted approach to live TV slip-ups. Last year she battled on despite accidently ‘clicking her clicker’ twice, revealing scorching temperatures of 99 degrees in a place identified as ‘Town name’. Speaking about her live gaffes, Mrs Kirkwood explained: ‘We can’t see the weather map behind us. Sometimes the map and town doesn’t pop up behind me and that has happened numerous times. You just have to get on with it.’ The glamorous weather presenter said she receives fan mail from enthusiastic older men who would send the explicit pictures in the post . And is seems some viewers have very high expectations of her capabilities. ‘People do blame me for bad weather, definitely,’ she revealed. ‘And also people’s expectations are high. People wanted to see snow this year. Some parts saw snow but by no means everywhere.’ She believes women of her age have a lot to bring to the profession. ‘More and more we are seeing women my kind of age and possibly older coming through the ranks to present the weather. It is good as we offer a load of experience,’ she said.

On Tuesday she was given the Weather Reporter gong at the Television and Radio Industries Club (TRIC) Awards for the seventh time, beating off ITV rival Laura Tobin (right) and the BBC’s Tomasz Schafernaker (left) And, although she thinks BBC Breakfast presenter Bill Turnbull, 59, would not make the cut as a weather presenter, she believes multitasking men can be just as good at the job. She revealed: ‘Bill Turnbull has tried to do it but he is more like a ballerina. When you present the weather it is like tapping your head and rubbing your tummy at the same time. 'If you can do it whether you are a man or a woman, then you can do it. We have got brilliant weather men as much as we have weather women. I don’t know if one is better than the other.’

    (CNN)After postponing its first execution of a woman in 70 years because of "cloudy" lethal injection drugs, Georgia has indefinitely postponed at least one other execution until it can analyze the cocktail it uses for the procedures, the state said Tuesday. Kelly Renee Gissendaner was scheduled to die at 7 p.m. ET Monday, but for the second time in less than a week, it was called off. The state postponed the first planned execution because of "weather and associated scheduling issues," department spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan said. "Prior to the execution, the drugs were sent to an independent lab for testing of potency. The drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits," the Georgia Department of Corrections said in a statement. "Within the hours leading up to the scheduled execution, the Execution Team performed the necessary checks. At that time, the drugs appeared cloudy. The Department of Corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist, and in an abundance of caution, Inmate Gissendaner's execution has been postponed." Repeating the "abundance of caution" wording, the department issued a news release Tuesday, saying, "The scheduled executions of Kelly Renee Gissendaner and Brian Keith Terrell have been postponed while an analysis is conducted of the drugs planned for use in last night's scheduled execution of inmate Gissendaner." Gissendaner, 47, is condemned to die for a 1997 murder plot in which she conspired with boyfriend Gregory Owen to murder her husband. Terrell was convicted in the shooting and beating death of a 70-year-old friend of his mother's after the man called police to say Terrell had stolen checks from him, according to the Georgia attorney general's office. Gissendaner has already requested an extravagant last meal: two Burger King Whoppers with cheese (with everything), two large orders of fries, popcorn, cornbread, a side of buttermilk and a salad with tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cheese, boiled eggs and Newman's Own buttermilk dressing, the Corrections Department said. She also requested a glass of lemonade and cherry-vanilla ice cream for dessert. Terrell was scheduled to die between March 10 and 17. Last year, Oklahoma issued a months-long moratorium on executions after murderer and rapist Clayton Lockett convulsed, writhed and lay alive on a gurney for 43 minutes before dying. It was the state's first time using a new, three-drug cocktail for an execution. The constitutionality of lethal injection drugs has made headlines since 2013, when European manufacturers -- including Denmark-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital -- banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions. Thirty-two states were left to find new drug protocols.

    A married father murdered a mother-of-two in her apartment before stealing her credit cards and using her car in a hit-and-run, police have said. Lyle Robert London, 38, has been arrested in the murder of Lindsay Brown Holbrook, a 32-year-old divorced mom he knew. She was found dead in her Washington Terrace, Utah home on Friday night. Sheriff's deputies had gone to the apartment after her car was involved in a hit-and-run, but when she failed to answer her door, they entered the home and found her desecrated body inside. She had suffered an apparent trauma but the cause of her death remains under investigation. Her body could have been there for a few days, Fox13 reported. Murdered: Lindsay Brown Holbrook, 32, was allegedly murdered by Lyle Robert London, right, inside her Utah apartment. Her body was found as police investigated a hit-and-run involving her vehicle . Tragic: Holbrook, who was divorced and lives alone, leaves behind her young daughter and son (pictured) Through evidence found in her car and witness accounts, police determined that London had been behind the wheel at the scene of the crash earlier that evening. Authorities say he knew his alleged victim, but would not detail how - only calling them 'associates'. Arrested: London's wife Shuree, 35, has also been arrested on suspicion of obstruction of justice . 'It is believed that he murdered her in her apartment and then tried to conceal the crime,' Weber County Sheriff's Lt. Lane Findlay said in a press release. Although police have not released a motive for the killing, after murdering the woman, London then took her financial cards and completed several fraudulent transactions, Findlay added. He was then involved in the hit-and-run accident near 3000 Washington Boulevard, police believe. A neighbor added to Fox13 that they had seen London going in and out of Holbrook's home in the days before her body was found. London was arrested at his Ogden home on suspicion of aggravated murder, obstruction of justice, abuse and desecration of a human body, and unlawful possession and use of a financial card. His wife, 35-year-old Shuree Laness London, was also arrested at a nearby hotel on suspicion of obstruction of justice. She allegedly 'had knowledge of this crime and assisted Mr. London after the fact,' Findlay said in the press release. Both are being held in the Weber County jail. Their Facebook profiles show they have been married for 13 years and have several children together - but Mrs London wrote on February 20 that they were having marital problems. 'I can honestly say we are going through a VERY VERY DIFFICULT time right now,' she wrote on her husband's profile. Family: The couple, pictured with their children, have numerous arrests between them, court records show . Shortly afterwards, she posted a message reading, 'A real relationship is where you can tell each other everything & anything. No secrets, no lies,' adding: 'I worked so hard for nothing.' Court records show that Lyle London has pleaded guilty to several misdemeanor charges since 1999, including possession of drug paraphernalia, intoxication, simple assault, criminal mischief, theft and various traffic violations, the Deseret News reported. His wife pleaded guilty to theft in 2010, as well as several traffic violations. In light of the most recent charges, their friend John Cleveland told Fox13: 'Knowing him and knowing his background that would not surprise me at all.' He added that he had heard London mention Holbrook's name. Facebook shows Holbrook was a mother to two young children, a boy and a girl. Fox13 reported that she was divorced from her husband and that it did not appear the children lived with her. Scene: Her body was found in her first-floor apartment, left, by sheriff's deputies just before midnight on Friday. Authorities have said she apparently suffered trauma but have not yet said how she died . Her family released a statement through the sheriff's office on Sunday afternoon. 'Lindsay was a loving mother, amazing aunt, wonderful sister, and she had an incredible sense of humor,' it said. 'She is loved by a lot of people and will be greatly missed.' An obituary shows that Holbrook's family also lost her younger brother, 27-year-old Nathan Brown, in January 2014. She leaves behind four other siblings. The family has asked for privacy as they grieve and make preparations for her funeral. 'Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to them,' the sheriff's office said. See below for video .

    Make no mistake. A first trophy as Celtic manager was a huge, significant step for Ronny Deila. He took the old cup from Rod Stewart, skipped down the Hampden steps and refused to let go until the ‘Ronny Roar’ — his ceremonial bonding session with the club’s supporters. But this was a day when sobriety was the Parkhead watchword. Sober reflection, followed by a sober celebration. Celtic’s first League Cup since 2009 is the platform for Deila to become only the third Celtic boss to win a domestic Treble. But that’s it. A piece in the jigsaw, no more. The Celtic players celebrate on the podium with the QTS Scottish League Cup after beating Dundee United 2-0 at Hampden Park . Celtic manager Ronny Deila gets ready to lift the Scottish League Cup with his players as The Bhoys kicked off their celebrations . A Scottish Cup replay against Dundee United — who else? — beckons on Wednesday and that ensured there was no prospect of Glasgow’s fast-food outlets cashing in on a Celtic team session last night. The players, captain Scott Brown included, were under orders to be in bed by midnight. ‘We should enjoy the moment,’ said a relieved Deila after an eventful, if unremarkable, final. ‘But there is not going to be any nightlife.’ We should have known Brown would be a key figure here again. The Celtic skipper escaped punishment for the tackle which triggered two red cards – both rescinded – when these teams met at Tannadice last week. His manager then overlooked the front-page pictures of a night of rabble-rousing in Edinburgh before the final. Yet the greatest let-off of all might have been here when referee Bobby Madden denied United – who ended the game with 10 men and a strong sense of injustice - a penalty kick.

Kris Commons (left), who scored Celtic's first after 28 minutes, poses with the Scottish League Cup trophy on Sunday . Dundee United (4-3-2-1): Cierzniak 7; Dillon 6, Morris 6, Fojut 6, Dixon 5; Paton 6 (Erskine 72), Butcher 6, Rankin 6; McGowan 6, Dow 6; Bilate 6(Anier 59) Subs not used: Szromnik, Souttar, Telfer, Connolly, Spittal . Booked: McGowan . Sent off: Dillon . Celtic (4-2-3-1): Gordon 6; Ambrose 7, Van Dijk 7, Denayer 7, Izaguirre 7, Bitton 8 (Henderson 81), Brown 7; Stokes 7, Johansen 7, Commons 7 (Forrest 67); Griffiths 7 (Guidetti 67). Subs not used: Zaluska, Scepovic, Fisher, McGregor. Goals: Commons 28, Forrest 79 . Referee: Bobby Madden . Attendance: 49,259 . MOTM: Nir Bitton. Celtic were ahead at the time. They had exploited their opponents being down to 10 men when skipper Sean Dillon collided with Virgil van Dijk and left the pitch in 23 minutes to receive stitches. He was gone for fully eight minutes. ‘I was about to make a change because it seemed to be taking too long,’ said manager Jackie McNamara afterwards. ‘It proved costly for us. ‘I had Blair Spittal ready to come on and I was going to put Ryan McGowan to right-back. Unfortunately, I don’t have a magic wand for those circumstances.’ Dillon would eventually leave the pitch on a permanent basis in the second half for a reckless challenge on Emilio Izaguirre in 56 minutes. Thereafter, Celtic dominated, scoring again through James Forrest and emphasising why the Tayside club were so willing to wait for their captain when he left the pitch for lengthy treatment. He wasn’t to blame for the insipid Paul Dixon free-kick which allowed Craig Gordon to gather and trigger a Celtic counter. But it was from his position that Anthony Stokes – who had a fine game - chipped a left-foot cross that was prodded towards goal by Kris Commons, changing direction as it came off the inner thigh of Jaroslaw Fojut. Somehow Rado Cierzniak in the United goal clawed it brilliantly on to the post, but Commons would not be denied, thumping the rebound emphatically into the net with his right foot for 1-0. ‘Hindsight is a wonderful thing,’ pondered McNamara. ‘If we had scored from that Dixon free-kick, everyone would be saying it was a great decision not to substitute him and give him a little more time.’ There was more cause for United regret in 36 minutes when Ryan Dow, chasing a through ball into the area was pushed in the back by Brown, a villainous figure through Tannadice eyes. Referee Madden had a good, long look then decided to turn the other way. Brown had ducked SFA punishment last weekend and here was the cause of another Tannadice gripe against authority. Not without justification, it should be said. James Forrest curls in the second goal for Ronny Deila's side as the Scottish Premiership leaders proved their superiority at Hampden Park . John Guidetti (left), on loan from Manchester City, celebrates Forrest's strike for The Hoops as they beat Dundee United . Celtic manager Ronny Deila urges his side to remain focused as they continue to chase a domestic treble . Forrest roars in celebration with the Celtic fans at Hampden Park erupting after Deila's team prevailed 2-0 in the Scottish League Cup final . Predictably, Deila – perhaps seeing it through green and white shades – saw things differently. ‘It was hard to say, but, from what I have been told, it was a good decision,’ he claimed. ‘I think the referee was very good. We are after him whenever he does something wrong, but you have to give them credit when they do a good job.’ In contrast, United foamed with frustration and knew they were done for when they went down to 10 men in 56 minutes. Last Sunday, Paul Paton and Dixon were sent packing. Paton’s proved to be a nonsense, but Dillon’s here was inarguable. The defender lunged into a dangerous challenge on Izaguirre. The Honduran was fortunate to escape serious injury. On the United touchline McNamara raged with the perceived injustice of it all. His side had lost the Scottish Cup Final against St Johnstone last May and they knew, now, another showpiece occasion was slipping away. Celtic’s extra man was telling. Dundee United captain Sean Dillon (right) is sent off for this late challenge on Celtic defender Emilio Izaguirre . Dillon can't hide his devastation after the Dundee United captain was sent for an early shower having been sent off at Hampden Park . In Stokes, Stefan Johansen and Nir Bitton, they had the best players on the pitch. In 67 minutes, Johansen got across Fojut to jab a Leigh Griffiths cross towards goal, the ball shaving the post en route to a narrow United escape. It was the last act for Griffiths before he made way for John Guidetti. James Forrest replaced the tiring Commons and the substitutes would make quite an impact. Forrest and Guidetti started brightly enough, the winger sweeping the critical second goal into the net from 16 yards in 78 minutes after the Swede teed up a Johansen cut-back. Their manager was less impressed with the very public falling out as the two haggled over a penalty kick five minutes from time. Kris Commons managed to fire Celtic ahead from an acute angle during the first-half, as Deila (right) roars in celebration . Commons put The Bhoys ahead on the half hour mark with his 11th goal of the season in all competitions with Celtic . Commons is congratulated by his team-mates having put the Scottish Premiership leaders in front during the League Cup final . Referee Madden showed no hesitation when Forrest was pulled back by Dixon. ‘He was very quick to point to the spot that time,’ said a caustic McNamara afterwards. Forrest grabbed the ball, resisting Guidetti’s determined and very vocal efforts to do the same. The winger placed the ball down, then placed a weak effort too close to Cierzniak, the United keeper preventing a third goal. An unimpressed Deila explained afterwards: ‘Both of the players who were going to take a penalty, Leigh Griffiths and Kris Commons, were off the park. It looks like it was the first to the ball, but I don’t like that they argue about that. Forrest earned Celtic a penalty late on under this challenge from Dundee United's Paul Dixon in the closing stages . Several Celtic players wanted Guidetti to take the spot-kick but Forrest insisted and eventually missed his penalty . ‘It is stupid. That is not the team spirit I want.’ As the final whistle signalled a significant day for the Norwegian, Guidetti marched straight down the tunnel in a huff, clearly furious. He was retrieved by Mikael Lustig, possibly on Deila’s orders. ‘There is a lot of emotion in these situations and strikers, especially, want to score goals,’ he continued. ‘Again, we have to put the team in front of ourselves. It is something we have work on all the time and learn from through experience. This is not team spirit. It is individual thinking - and I don’t want anything to do with that.’ Collectively, Celtic have much to excite them. A Treble hovers on the horizon. The late night celebrations can wait.

    Liverpool and Manchester United may be two wounded animals, but the pair have a serious backer in Pele, who insists their derby is on a par with El Clasico. The legendary striker will be at Anfield on Sunday to witness who steals a march in the race for Champions League qualification, asserting that this clash cannot be bettered in world football. Real Madrid and Barcelona do battle at the Nou Camp on Sunday, but United’s trip to Merseyside will be watched by just as many around the globe. Brazilian legend Pele believes Manchester United's trip to Liverpool will be on a par with Sunday's El Clasico . United players celebrate during their side's 3-0 victory against Liverpool at Old Trafford in December . Luis Suarez (left), Neymar and Lionel Messi will play a part as Barcelona take on Real Madrid on Sunday . According to Pele, that is what makes it a standout fixture in the calendar. ‘They are very, very similar games,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘It’s one of the best in today’s game. I always look forward to going to Anfield. I love to see good football. ‘Barcelona have excellent players. It’s not only Lionel Messi, but Xavi and Neymar. Maybe they have more individuals, but as a team Liverpool are the same.’ It is quite a show of support for the Premier League, which has a number of questions to address after a dismal fortnight in continental competition, with each of England’s remaining representatives crashing out of Europe. 2014 Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo will come face to face with Messi once again at the Nou Camp . The World Cup winner speaks with Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan ahead of the crucial Premier League clash . Pele, who will visit Anfield for the sixth time on Sunday, doesn’t buy into suggestions English football’s power is waning. ‘Oh yes, definitely,’ he said when asked if the Premier League remained the best division in the world. ‘It pains me as a Brazilian, but I have to say that. Even after the problems in Europe. ‘Remember, losing is part of the game. I don’t think there’s anything wrong - it’s something you can’t explain. ‘But there is no doubt that it’s the top league.’ Pele will be in attendance at Anfield on Sunday to watch Louis van Gaal's side take on Liverpool . The former Santos star compared Steven Gerrard (pictured) to German great Franz Beckenbauer . Pele admits that both Beckenbauer, seen here playing against Holland in the 1974 World Cup, and Gerrard would make his all-star team . Pele was also forthright in his views on Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, who he puts on a pedestal with the great Franz Beckenbauer and says would make his World XI. Asked where Gerrard would rank among the best midfielders of all time, the 74-year-old compared him with Germany’s biggest ever star. ‘Maybe people don’t remember, but Beckenbauer had the same style,’ he added. ‘I like Gerrard, he is a similar intelligent player. There is no doubt they’d both make my team.’ And Pele, flashing a wide grin, stated that Lionel Messi’s one-footed nature and lack of aerial presence gives himself the edge when pundits compare the two: ‘I used to kick it with both feet. I never saw myself play, but I think I was the better player.’ The 74-year-old joked that he was a 'better player' than Lionel Messi because the Brazilian used both feet . SUBWAY Famous Fan Pele visted a London SUBWAY store to discuss football, nutrition and training in the run up to the Liverpool v Manchester United football match on Sunday March 22 .

    Brazi legend Pele will be at Anfield on Sunday to watch Liverpool take on Manchester United .

"The band, crew and most importantly the family of AJ Pero thank you for your thoughts and prayers at this time." Pero was 55. Pero died of what appears to be a massive heart attack, his longtime agent Dan Stanton told CNN. "He had been complaining of a sore arm all week and took a few days off from his tour with the band Adrenaline Mob," says Stanton. Pero had been on a tour with the band in Poughkeepsie, New York, and was scheduled to play tonight, according to Stanton. Twisted Sister guitarist Jay Jay French told CNN that Pero was found this morning in his tour bus. He was taken to a hospital and died there. "We are devastated. He was a great guy and one of the best drummers," French said. "To lose someone you have depended on for 33 years ... I don't know what it is going to be like to be on stage without him.  I can't even think about what it will be like." Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider tweeted about the death. "Today I lost a brother. Anthony Jude Pero passed away," Snider said in a statement. "His sledgehammer assault on the drums helped drive Twisted Sister and I to greatness and inspired me to rock every single show. My heart breaks knowing I will never feel the power of his beat behind me, or turn to see his face smiling broadly from the sheer joy he got from doing what he loved." Pero joined Twisted Sister, best known for its 1984 song "We're Not Gonna Take It" and accompanying comedic video, in 1982. Though he left for a time in 1987 to join another band, he reunited with Twisted Sister in the 1990s and was with the band for the past 12 years, according to Loudwire.com. In the "We're Not Gonna Take It" video, which also starred "Animal House's" Mark Metcalf, Pero can be seen in concert, hitting a drum that brings up a cloud of glitter. In recent years, he was also the drummer for the band Adrenaline Mob. CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this story.

    Chelsea's Lewis Baker has spoken of his pride at captaining England's under 20 side and believes he is only just setting out on his journey with the Three Lions. The 19-year-old, who is currently out on loan at League One side MK Dons, featured for England in their 1-1 draw with Mexico at Barnet on Wednesday night. Aidy Boothroyd's team won the penalty shoot-out 4-2 after Arsenal striker Chuba Akpom won and then scored a penalty in normal time to cancel out Jose Ramirez's opener. Lewis Baker in action for England's under 20s in their international with Mexico on Wednesday night . The midfielder was appointed captain by Aidy Boothroyd at the beginning of the season . On the responsibility of being captain, Baker told Sportsmail: 'It's a great honour for me. Aidy chose me to be captain at the start of the campaign and that was a massive lift for me personally. 'But everyone in the team, we're all captains on the pitch in the game and we showed today that we can be a team and stick together through the bad times. 'I try to lead by example in what I do on the ball and off the ball. Everyone's aim to get to the under 21s and the seniors. 'All we can do is keep working hard, keeping doing what we can do and give your best.' Although England looked the more likely to score after Mexico goalkeeper Raul Gudino was sent off for fouling Akpom for the penalty, they had been second best for much of the friendly at The Hive. As they look towards the Toulon Tournament at the end of the season, Baker believes there is some room for improvement, starting with Sunday's friendly with the United States at Plymouth. Baker celebrates scoring for Chelsea in last season's Under 21 Premier League final with Manchester United . England under 20s coach Aidy Boothroyd smiles during Wednesday night's match at The Hive . England's under 20s are in action again on Sunday when they play the United States at Home Park in Plymouth. Ticket information can be found here. 'We didn't perform today at the level we have performed at in previous games,' he admitted. 'They were a good side; I thought first-half they had the upper hand and could have scored a few goals but we kept persevering, stayed in the game, had a little talk at half-time on how to get better and we got the result.' Akpom, who has been on the fringes of Arsene Wenger's first team all season, took his England under 20s tally to four when he drilled home his 78th minute penalty. And Baker appreciates his game-changing qualities: 'When Chuba goes through on goal, everyone gets out of their seat because they know Chuba is a great goalscorer. He's done well today, getting the penalty and he scored in the shoot-out as well.' Chuba Akpom of England scores their equaliser from the penalty spot for England Under 20s . England players celebrate during the penalty shoot-out against Mexico on Wednesday night . On a personal level, Baker has scored two goals in five appearances for the Dons since arriving from Stamford Bridge and is set to play a pivotal role as Karl Robinson's men push for promotion. He said: 'I've been playing under 21 at Chelsea for a while now and so the next step was to go on loan and at MK Dons now I'm under great care with the manager and the players. 'With the talent we have got at MK Dons there's no reason why we can't get into the play-offs or even gain automatic promotion.'

    It's a complaint heard in grand houses up and down the country – they just can't get the staff. And it is a problem that even afflicts Downton Abbey as the producers prepare to shoot what will be the sixth – and final – season. So popular have its stars become that they are cashing in on 'the Downton Factor' to take up lucrative film and television jobs in America. The majority of the cast have spent the past few months auditioning in Hollywood, and a source said: 'Everyone connected with the show knows that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.' One LA producer said: 'I've had more than one agent for the stars of Downton coming on to me asking what is available. 'They've all been in town, trying to get their faces out there, trying to cash in on that goodwill and grab work while they can. 'The Downton Factor has become something of a joke in LA. You can't turn around at a dinner table without seeing another face from the series. 'Of course, most of the Downton cast are classically or theatre-trained, so there's no question that they can act. But the big question is can they prove they are more than one-hit wonders?' Here we take a look at those who have already gone west as part of the Downton brain drain... Scroll down for video .

    (CNN)Madonna, saying something controversial? Perish the thought. The object of her scorn fighting back? Of course. The mayor of Rochester, Michigan, has written an open letter to the venerable pop star, taking her to task for saying she never wanted to go back the town where she went to high school. "I can't be around basic, provincial-thinking people," she told Howard Stern last week on his SiriusXM satellite radio program. You could almost hear the steam coming out of Mayor Bryan Barnett's ears. "It's like someone calling one of your kids ugly," the Detroit Free Press quoted Barnett as saying. "You're not going to let that go by without a response." In his letter, published Monday in the Free Press, Barnett said the city's recent achievements are anything but provincial. "Our school district is one of the top performing in the state and boasts two Blue Ribbon Schools, the most in Michigan. Our Universities are among the fastest growing in the Midwest and are rich with cultural and ethnic diversity," he wrote. Buying Madonna's house: A tale of fame and misfortune . "We design and build more robots than any other city in North America, and Rochester Hills residents and businesses have been granted over 900 patents, nearly one a day, over the last three years. Not a typical achievement you would associate with 'simple or basic' people," he wrote. He also noted the city was also named one of the 10 best places to live by Money magazine. "We are many things, Madonna, but basic and provincial minded we are not!" Barnett wrote. "I invite you back to Rochester Hills to see who we are and what we believe in. While we certainly don't need your stamp of approval, I am quite confident we would earn it." Not surprisingly, some Rochester Hills citizens weren't thrilled with Madonna's comments. "Makes me proud to live in Rochester Hills after reading this letter to Madonna by @MayorBarnett," Twitter user LoganBrown97 wrote. And although Madonna hasn't responded to the fracas, she of course found some defenders on social media. "Why is everyone mad Madonna said Rochester was basic?" Twitter user itsleah wrote. "It IS basic. I thought that was the appeal? Small towns AREN'T for everyone, dummies." Of course, Madonna is no stranger to controversy, and she's angered organizations a lot bigger and more powerful than Rochester City Hall. Remember the 1980s, when her "Like a Prayer" video angered the Catholic church? Or the 1990s, when it seemed a camera couldn't turn her direction without capturing simulated masturbation? Then there was last year, when she had to backtrack after posting an Instagram photo of her son boxing, captioned with a take on the N-word. And in January, some took offense after she posted photos of civil rights icons altered to appear like the cover of her new album. Heck, this isn't even the the first time the singer has dissed a place where she grew up. In a 1987 interview with Jane Pauley, she called Bay City, Michigan, where she was born, a "little smelly town in northern Michigan." A few moments later, Madonna followed up by saying she had "great affection" for the place. So far, no such love for Rochester Hills. Nor has the pop icon accepted the mayor's invite to return to her hometown for a visit.

    A dying father known as 'napkin dad' for his daily heartfelt notes to his daughter, has celebrated seeing her achieve another milestone: making her high school varsity softball team. Garth Callaghan, 45, from Glen Allen, Virginia, has been writing short messages on napkins for his daughter Emma, 15, since she was in kindergarten - and now she looks forward to them every day. The heartwarming ritual has scored him a book deal and a movie is said to be in the works too. This week the doting father-of-one - who has stage four kidney cancer - uploaded a snapshot to Facebook revealing his latest note, reading: 'Dear Emma, I'm so proud that you made the varsity softball team. I can't wait till your first game!' Scroll down for video .

Heartwarming ritual: This week the doting father-of-one, who has prostate and kidney cancer, uploaded this snapshot to Facebook revealing his latest note . Garth says doctors do not know how long he has to live but he's determined to remain strong. 'My goal is to actually write notes for my grandkids and I can't think of a better thing to fight for every single day.' Emma says that she also maintains a positive attitude when it comes to her father's illness. 'I don't even really think about the fact he has cancer too much because he's so present and always there.' The note-writing has long been a tradition in the Callaghan household; it began when Garth worked a busy sales job in Emma's elementary school days and wouldn't see her often.

Daily dose: So that she always knew her father was thinking of her, Garth would write the notes - which were then just hearts, stars and simple words - and include them in her lunch box . Still going strong: But over the years, the notes have developed into words of advice or of encouragement on test days, and by the time she was about eight, Emma had come to expect the memos . So that she always knew her father was thinking of her, Garth would write the notes - which were then just hearts, stars and simple words - and include them in her lunch box. But over the years, the notes have developed into words of advice or of encouragement on test days, and by the time she was about eight, Emma had come to expect the memos. Some days, she would look at her lunch before he had placed on inside, and she'd demand to know where it was. 'That's when I realized, this is something that really matters,' Garth said. Garth's wife, Lissa, said the task also means he's taken over the chore of making his daughter's lunch, which he tries to keep healthy. 'I think it's great,' she said. 'It's nice that he keeps that connection with her.' Lunchtime treat: He pops the notes in with her lunch, which he tries to make as nutritious as he can . Determined: After learning he had cancer, Garth sought to write 800 notes so that his daughter would have one every day throughout high school - even if he was no longer alive to put it in her lunch box . But in 2011, Garth was diagnosed with cancer and his desire to write the notes became even stronger because, 'at the end of the day, these notes might be the only thing my daughter has left of me'. His tumor was successfully removed - but he has since been diagnosed twice more, and his doctor has told him that he will lose his life to the disease. A loss of taste, tiredness and nausea are among the symptoms which blight Garth. He says his ultimate hope is to inspire parents to write notes to their children. His book, Napkin Notes: Make Lunch Meaningful, Life Will Follow, has been published in several countries and half a dozen languages. In the tome, Garth  introduces each chapter with a napkin note and then shares a story connected to it and to his life. The cancer patient is now writing notes ahead of time and storing them away so his daughter can still receive them after he is gone. Devoted to Emma: Garth is pictured with Emma, his and his wife's only child, in her younger years . Impact: Tiredness and nausea are among the symptoms which blight Garth (seen here with Emma)

    Hong Kong (CNN)"Go back home!" "Locusts! You're not welcome here!" These were just some of the insults hurled at Chinese shoppers Sunday as hundreds of Hong Kongers surged through through the old neighborhood of Yuen Long, an area close to the city's border with China. It was the latest in a series of angry protests that have seen brawls erupt in humdrum shopping malls, with demonstrators singling out the "parallel traders" who crowd into Hong Kong to purchase tax-free products and then resell them for a profit back in China. "I've grown up here, and ever since a lot of the Chinese started coming into Hong Kong, things have changed," said Suen, a law student who only gave her surname. Clad in a mask to protect against police wielding pepper spray, she took part in the protest with her mother. Local residents say the traders are not only disturbing the peace, but are driving up the price of food, rent, and gutting local neighborhoods of their character - the city has become a blur of jewelers, pharmacies and other businesses that cater primarily to Chinese shoppers. "Previously there were a lot of indigenous places like restaurants, but all of them have closed," said Suen, standing across from a store selling baby milk powder - the top item on many Chinese tourists' shopping lists. "It's very difficult to be very welcoming." Tensions have long been simmering between Hong Kong and the motherland, and parallel trading is just one of the thorny issues brought about by the influx of mainland Chinese to the city. A series of food scandals -- most notably in 2008 when melamine-tainted milk powder caused infant deaths across China -- led to shortages of baby milk formula in Hong Kong as Chinese flocked to buy up the city's supplies. The ensuing uproar led the government to introduce a law limiting the purchase to two tins per traveler leaving the city. Last year, 31 million Chinese visitors traveled to Hong Kong, accounting for 78% of all tourists, according to the government. But the numbers hide that the visitors aren't all sightseeing tourists in the traditional sense. There are the day-trippers, wheeling suitcases and carting boxes of goods and supplies across the border, but there is also an increasing number of wealthy mainland Chinese who are buying up luxury properties, and visit the city on a regular basis. According to the Global Property Guide, developers say as much as 40% of new home buyers are from China. Residents blame them for causing a hike in real estate prices in what reports say is already the most expensive property market in the world. Both the Chinese and Hong Kong government have encouraged mainland tourists to visit the city and boost the local economy. Relaxed restrictions have made it easy for Chinese residents to get a hold of individual multiple-entry permits -- some mainlanders enter hundreds of times a year on a single pass. This has infuriated protestors, particularly the younger generation, who want the government to scrap the permits. In a speech last Tuesday,  the city's pro-Beijing leader C.Y. Leung announced that his government would examine restricting mainland visitors, acknowledging the pressure the crowds have had on the everyday lives of Hong Kong residents. But the permit controversy is just one symptom of a deeper conflict. When it comes down to it, it's simple: Many Hong Kongers just don't feel very Chinese. According to a recent survey by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the number of Hong Kong residents identifying primarily as "Chinese" has dipped to an all-time low since the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997. The majority of respondents said they were "Hong Kongers first, and also Chinese." Earlier in 2012, plans to add Chinese civic education into the Hong Kong public school curriculum caused an uproar, resulting in a city-wide protest with locals claiming it would "brainwash" school children with pro-mainland propaganda. Hong Kong, ruled under China's principle of "One country, two systems," means the city is a officially part of China, but is allowed rights and freedoms unseen in other Chinese cities. But there's one key privilege Beijing has refused to grant to Hong Kong: Free and open elections for their own leader. Frustrated Hong Kongers have tried everything to demand greater voting rights, from hunger strikes to massive street occupations, with no luck. That's why people in Hong Kong feel an increasing sense of resentment and helplessness when it comes to solving the complex, growing rift between their city and mainland China. A small but growing minority of disgruntled activists go as far as to say Hong Kong should not belong to China at all. "We Hong Kong people have our own culture, we have our own currency, we have all the requirements to build a country." said Julian Li, a member of a radical pro-Hong Kong group. "For decades we have been fighting against civic rights, democracy. However, no matter how much we have been working, it's like we're begging for something that will never happen." Many mainland Chinese are bewildered by the anger directed at them. "It's normal for people to spend money and shop here, why are they protesting?" said a Chinese tourist waiting at a bus stop to get away from the angry crowds. She said her suitcase was loaded with make-up and clothing that is much cheaper to buy in Hong Kong than across the border in her hometown of Zhuhai. "There's definitely an element of discrimination against mainlanders here. I'm not saying everyone is like that in Hong Kong, but there are certain people who are very prejudiced," she added. Another Chinese resident who makes weekly visits to relatives in the city was sitting on a curb away from the ruckus. She said her friends have considered boycotting Hong Kong altogether. "My friends on WeChat say, don't come to Hong Kong, let's burn our travel permits," she said as she thumbed through the receipts of her latest purchases. "We should all just be more considerate and tolerant of each other, we're just here to shop. Let's just be happy," she said.

    Proud pose: Tory poster boy Afzal Amin, in ceremonial Army uniform, whose political career is in ruins . Afzal Amin was to be the Tories’ poster boy at the General Election. But his political career was in ruins last night as he suffered the shame of being suspended from the party over his self-serving plot to win votes by stirring up racial hatred. It is a spectacular fall from grace for a politician from a humble background who seemed set for high office with the Conservatives but is now a victim of his over-reaching political ambition. Amin was the first ethnic minority candidate to be chosen for this year’s poll, and has been pictured alongside Prime Minister David Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne and the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. The 40-year-old has appeared on the BBC’s flagship Newsnight programme four times and was praised when he spoke out against the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby by Islamists, insisting that Muslims were an ‘integral part’ of Britain. Despite his ambitions, Amin – who is married with two teenage children – has not been afraid to criticise Conservative Party bosses. Last year he admitted that many ethnic minority voters in his target seat of Dudley North, held by a Labour majority of just 649, think that the Tories ‘remain a racist party’. And he told a newspaper that British society and political leaders as well as community leaders must share the blame for the ‘jihad generation’ that is travelling to Syria to join murderous Islamic State. His high-profile position with the Conservatives and sought-after views contrast markedly with his humble beginnings. Amin was brought up in the deprived Black Country town of Smethwick, where the Tories had once infamously used openly racist slogans on election leaflets. He left school with practically no qualifications and took a series of menial jobs, including being a waiter, before going to university in London as a mature student. His fortunes changed in 2001 when he was selected to attend training at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. He rose to the rank of captain and saw active service in Iraq and did three tours in Afghanistan. Role model: A campaign poster encouraging youngsters to canvass for him . Influential: With Justin Welby at a seminar about sex crimes in war last year . High profile: Meeting George Osborne at train manufacturer Bombardier in Derby . Spokesman: Interviewed on BBC News about the murder of Lee Rigby and the effect on the Muslim community . Later moving into an educational role, he says he was a personal tutor to Princes William and Harry, as well as serving as chairman of the Armed Forces Muslim Association. After leaving the Army he set up a consultancy called The Curzon Education Ltd, which won a £120,000 grant to give lectures to schoolchildren about the role of Commonwealth soldiers in the First World War. It sparked controversy as the grant was given by the Department for Communities, where his ‘political acquaintance’ Baroness Warsi was a Minister. Mr Amin worked at the Army’s Counterinsurgency And Stabilisation Centre and has given lectures at the UK Defence Academy. He describes himself on Twitter as ‘International Conflict and Stabilisation Adviser Government Strategist Fragile States.’ On the photosharing website Flickr he posted a picture of himself meeting Sir Nicholas Soames – Winston Churchill’s MP grandson – and wrote: ‘In late 2003 I was working on anti-hijacking operations in Southern Basra. We were visited by Sir Nicholas Soames MP whom I briefed about our work tackling gangs with Iraqi police.’ Harry, Wills... and a vicious assault . Afzal Amin: Yeah he [a reference to a man involved in the 2011 riots] punched a guy in the face. Who hasn’t done that? The difference between you and me is one thing: I haven’t been caught. LAUGHS . …Even in Windsor, I was Education Officer for Prince Harry and Prince William, I headbutted a guy, his face exploded. But when the police turned up they see me in a suit – cashmere suit with a briefcase and they see this guy hoodie up, cap on. Male [a friend of Amin]: What was he doing? AA: Wheeling all over the place... They can’t work out why would the guy in the suit crack that guy? Amin, pictured left, in Basra with fellow officers and MP Sir Nicholas Soames, boasted of being the Princes William and Harry's Education Officer . ‘I’m not a Paki, am I?’ AA: I’ll have tandoori prawn for the main. Can you make it as mild as possible? Waiter: It’s marinated in the spice already. AA: Yeah can you rinse it off? Tommy Robinson: You don’t like spicy food? AA: No, I’m not a Paki am I? Newsnight boasts . Naim Akhtar [AA’s friend, talking about a Conservative gathering of ‘your white, working class people.’]: Out of all the people that were there Afzal says to me, ‘Let’s wait here, he’ll come to us.’ David Cameron walked up to us and said, ‘Afzal, how are you? How is your campaign?’ We had a good five or 10-minute chat, the way we’re chatting now. Out of all the people in the room... AA: They know who I am. Naim: They know him. The only candidate in the whole of the UK who’s been on Newsnight four times. AA: They’ve already asked me what sort of committees do you want to serve on, they’re that sure I’m going to win.

Summarized text: 
    Afzal Amin was to be the Tories’ poster boy at General Election. But his political career is in fact in ruin as he suffered shame of being suspended - and is now a victim from his overreaching political ambition – but has not been afraid for criticism despite his high-profile position with the Conservatives & conservative party.

    History man Steven Fletcher has spoken of his pride as he ended a six-year international scoring drought to become the first Scotland player to net a hat-trick since 1969. The Sunderland striker hit his treble in the 6-1 triumph over Gibraltar, with two Shaun Maloney penalties and a Steven Naismith strike also helping Hampden recover from the shock of Lee Casciaro’s first-half equaliser for the Group D minnows. Not since Colin Stein bagged four against Cyprus in 1969 had someone scored more than two for the national side. Steven Fletcher celebrates after scoring the second of his three goals against Gibraltar on Sunday . Fletcher (right) curls the ball around the Gibraltar defence to net his third goal of the game at Hampden Park . Regardless of the weak opposition in the Euro 2016 qualifier - albeit the Scots fell victim to the visitors’ first-ever competitive goal to make it 1-1 - Fletcher admitted he was thrilled to have achieved a feat that eluded even the great Kenny Dalglish. ‘I got asked after the Northern Ireland game if I could get a hat-trick and I laughed it off,’ said Fletcher. ‘I said I would be happy with one goal as I haven’t scored for a while. So to get the hat-trick was really pleasing. I was delighted. Gibraltar goalkeeper Jamie Robba dives to his right but is unable to stop the ball hitting the back of the net . Sunderland forward Fletcher is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against minnows Gibraltar . ‘I’ve been told that it was 46 years since the last Scotland hat-trick and I was shocked. ‘I thought Kenny would have managed it so I am very happy and proud to be part of history. ‘It means a lot. It’s really good and it will be one of the best achievements of my career. ‘I’ve got the match ball and I’ll probably put it in a little glass cabinet. I have another one from my Hibs days when I scored a hat-trick against Gretna, so I will put it next to that. That was my last hat-trick so it will go beside that one.’ Fletcher had last scored for Scotland against Iceland in 2009, and had drawn a blank since his return from a 19-month international exile in 2011. The 28-year-old gave thanks to Gordon Strachan for sticking by him and hopes this boost will help him over the remainder of the Euro 2016 campaign, which continues with a crunch trip to Dublin in June. Fletcher was recently mocked on Twitter for buying a Lamborghini after inconsistent form for his club . Scotland boss Gordon Strachan admitted he is upbeat at his side's position in Group D after their win . ‘It’s been a while since I scored for Scotland and I was aware of that. I get told every day,’ he said. ‘It’s good to get off the mark again, especially after being out for a long time. Was it getting to me? Not really. I was still confident going in to games. ‘To be honest I haven’t had many chances in games but I had a lot against Gibraltar. I could have scored more than three but I was just happy to get the goals. ‘Getting the hat-trick will definitely help my confidence going into the summer. Hopefully I have done enough to stay in the gaffer’s plans and I’m looking forward to it. ‘The manager likes my link-up play. I know people have been saying I haven’t scored but I’ve been doing other parts. ‘He’s praised me for that and if I can keep doing that, and add goals, then I’ll be happy. ‘He’s been a massive support to me. He’s been great with me since I came back into the Scotland squad and I owe a lot to him.’

Summary target: 
    Scotland beat Gibraltar 6-1 in their European qualifier on Saturday .
Steven Fletcher scored a hat-trick; Scotland's first in 46 years .
Fletcher scored his first goals in international football since April 2009 .

    Almost 1,000 migrants have been rescued in a 24 hour period as their boats floundered crossing the Mediterranean on their way to Europe. At least ten people perished when their vessel carrying around 130 people capsized in freezing waters off the Libyan coast. The Italian coast guard had rushed to the scene after being alerted by a tugboat working for Libyan offshore oil rigs and were able to save around 121 people. Scroll down for videos .

Italian officials carry a coffin containing the body of one of the migrants who perished at sea . The coastguard ship Dattilo brought 439 migrants to Augusta along with the corpses of the 10 drowned migrants . Last month around 300 Sub Saharan Africans were thought to have drowned trying to cross the sea when their boats overturned in 20 foot waves. Pictured is a coffin being unloaded by Italian officials in Augusta . In the first two months of this year, 7,882 migrants arrived in Italy by boat, a figure that has surged by 43 per cent on last year’s record numbers, according to figures from Italy's interior ministry. In the 24 hours between Tuesday and Wednesday Italy's Coast Guard rescued a total of 941 migrants in seven rescue operations in the Sicilian Channel, it said. Two rubber dinghies and five boats carrying Syrians Palestinians, Tunisians, Libyans as well as sub Saharan Africans were rescued in waters about 50 miles north of Libya. Among the rescued were more than 30 children and one pregnant woman, who was taken to hospital for urgent medical attention. The swelling numbers demonstrate the increasing desperation of those attempting to flee the growing chaos and bloodshed in Libya. The rescue vessels saved 941 people in seven separate operations that began on Tuesday. The coast guard said the migrants (pictured) saved in the latest rescues claimed to be Syrians, Palestinians, Libyans, Tunisians or from sub-Saharan Africa .

At the end of the year the Italian government closed their comprehensive search and rescue operation Mare Nostrum, which cost nine million euros a month, saying it was too much responsibility for Italy alone. It was replaced by the scaled-down Triton mission, a border control operation which patrols only the area 30 miles around the European coast. Last month around 300 Sub Saharan Africans were thought to have drowned trying to cross the sea when their boats overturned in 20 foot waves. Mauro Casinghini, Head of Rescue for the Order of Malta in Italy, said that Frontex was ‘no substitute’ for Mare Nostrum. He said that he expects thousands more people to die this year. The summer season for travel no longer exists he said. ‘If sea is calm they go. If sea is rough they don’t go. The problem is, if the bat capsizes and the water is cold, they die quicker. ‘ . Those rescued were taken to Sicily on Tuesday. More than 183 were expected to arrive at Pozzallo on Wednesday with an oil tanker while another 319 was approaching Porto Empedocle. The coastguard ship Dattilo was bringing 439 migrants to Augusta along with the corpses of the 10 drowned migrants. MP Maurizio Gasparri of Berlusconi's centre right Forza Italia said: 'Hundreds of migrants ready to disembark and a new tragedy in the Sicilian Channel. An ongoing disaster which this incompetent government cannot tackle. It continues to tolerate the cynical action of criminals in so doing feeding the rapidly growing phenomenon of trafficking. Terrorists ready to strike our country may be among them.' MP Matteo Salvini leader of the anti-immigration Northern League said: ‘ Another 10 dead and 900 illegal immigrants landing. In Rome and Brussels there are many with full pockets and blood on their hands. Stop the boats setting off, stop the deaths, stop the invasion.’

    It is possible that Hillary Clinton distributed sensitive information through her personal email, the State Department now admits, and only a review of her messages will determine if she broke the rules. A State Department official who spoke to The Washington Post acknowledged that some of the correspondence Clinton sent through her private email may constitute a breach of security guidelines. The official asserted that Clinton didn't directly defy State's policies by using her personal email for government communications, but a manual obtained by news outlets shows that since 2005 State has directed its employees to use its email system because it has the 'proper level of security control.' The former secretary of state's team has responded to a storm of criticism surrounding Clinton's email practices by hunkering down and waiting for it to pass. The former secretary of state's team has responded to a storm of criticism surrounding Clinton's email practices by hunkering down and waiting for it to pass. But top communications gurus are recommending the campaign immediately act to deflate 'email-gate' State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf insists that Mrs. Clinton didn't send any classified material through her private 'clintonemails.com' account while she led the agency . But top communications gurus are recommending the campaign immediately act to deflate email-gate. Democrats in early states worry the scandal is an early warning sign that Clinton's presumed presidential campaign is on the path to destruction and could 'implode.' From the outset, the State Department has cautiously avoided declaring Clinton innocent of any wrongdoing while encouraging reporters to give her the benefit of the doubt. 'She and her team has said that it was not used for anything but unclassified work,' Marie Harf, deputy spokeswoman for State told reporters on Wednesday, adding moments later, 'I don’t think there was any indication she was doing anything but [that] here, so I don’t think it’s really a pertinent question.' Further pressed to 'definitively' claim Clinton wasn't sending classified information through her personal email – which is against the law – Harf argued that 'you can’t claim that about anyone’s unclassified email.' She also noted in the exchange that the department doesn't monitor its other employees' private communications to make sure that classified information isn't being shared. 'I’m not sure why this would be anything different,' Harf contended. 'I don’t know why this would be held to a different standard.' When Clinton did need to discuss classified information she communicated through her her staff, the State Department spokeswoman claimed. Later asked if Clinton's exclusive use of personal email was 'problematic,' Harf stated that that 'there was no prohibition on this practice.' 'So I’m not going to make a judgment about appropriateness or not,' she said. 'I’m telling you what the regulations say and don’t say. She operated under them, and that’s as much as I can say.' Guidelines published by Politico and other publications on Thursday evening suggest otherwise, however. 'It is the Department’s general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized [Automated Information System], which has the proper level of security control to provide nonrepudiation, authentication and encryption, to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the resident information,' the State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual says. An official who spoke to Politico said that it is true that 'sensitive but unclassified information should be handled on a system with certain security requirements' with the caveat 'except in certain circumstances.' The State Department insider said it's not true that 'by using personal email she is automatically out of step' with the guidelines outlined in the manual. Likewise, the Post's source at State said, 'We are not going to prejudge the outcome of the review of Secretary Clinton’s 55,000 pages of e-mails.' National Democrats aligned with Clinton are blowing off the email squabble as background noise that won't affect voters' perceptions of their party's most formidable presidential candidate. 'Voters do not give a s*** about what email Hillary used. They don't even give a fart,' Paul Begala,  confidante of and adviser to Bill Clinton,' said Thursday on CNN. Media Matters founder David Brock said in an op-ed on CNN that the media 'hype' around Clinton's emails is the 'perfect example of "gotcha" journalism, where reporters will take any bait the Republicans give them without proper vetting.' Brock, whose group American Bridge runs a pro-Clinton fact-checking service called Correct the Record, also argued that the Clintons 'are held to a double standard when it comes to media scrutiny.' 'Their perfectly usual, above board behavior is spun as secretive and unaccountable -- while Republicans are left relatively unscathed,' he charged. Regardless, top level communicators on the left and the right say that Clinton currently risks mishandling the crisis. Former Barack Obama senior adviser David Axelrod has said that the longer Clinton and her team wait to respond to the flurry of questions about her use of not only a non-official email for her work at the State Department but also a personal domain name and a private server, the likelier the situation is to get out of hand. 'It’s a ball of wool that won’t go away until the questions are answered,' he told the New York Times on Thursday. DUELING TWEETS, PART I: Likely Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush goaded Clinton to be more transparent . DUELING TWEETS, PART II: Clinton responded by saying 'I want the public to see my email' and asking her old agency to hurry up the process . Ari Fleisher, a former spokesman for George W. Bush, told Bloomberg, Clinton's team is 'making a big mistake' by not letting her address the issue publicly. 'This is immediately understood and problematic in the eyes of the average voter. Everyone can relate to it and understand it … it cuts through the clutter in a way that hurts her,' he said. 'This is one of those issues that’s not going away anytime soon.' Clinton fired off a tweet on Wednesday night saying she wanted the public to read her emails and had given the State Department permission to publish them once they it finishes its review. And a spokesman for her confirmed to the press at the beginning of the week that all of her emails that pertain to the State Department have been remanded to the federal government. Questions continue to linger, however, and neither Clinton nor her team have given a reasonable explanation for the former Obama administration official's actions. Larry Hogden, chairman of Iowa’s Cedar County Democrats, told Politico the email controversy 'adds more reason' for other politicians in the party to explore presidential campaigns. 'Because, who knows? She could implode totally,' he said.

    The implantation of memories is a common feature in sci-fi films, such as Inception and Total Recall. But now, for the first time, conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while they slept. The feat  gives hope that the same technique could one day be used to change human memories, which could help people who replay traumatic events over and over in their minds. For the first time, conscious memories have been implanted into the minds of mice while the sleep. The technique could one day be used to change human memories, such in in films like Total Recall and Inception ( a still from the film is shown) The brain typically replays the day’s activities when people or animals sleep, which allows it to reinforce and learn a new activity, for example. Experts have found that when this replay process is disrupted in rodents, so too is their ability to remember what they learned – for example, a new area that they explored – the previous day, New Scientist reported. Scientists from the Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution in Paris, France, used this replay process to create new memories in the brains of mice, while they slept. The team, led by Karim Benchenane, focused on place cells - which are neurons that fire in response to thinking about, or being in, a specific place – and help animals and humans form internal maps. The brain typically replays the day’s activities when people or animals sleep, which allows it to reinforce and learn a new activity, for example. Scientists used this replay process to create new memories in the brains of mice, while they slept - and say it could one day be used in humans while they sleep (stock image) In the same way that humans sometimes remember things that didn’t actually occur, researchers have found that bees also misremember. It’s the first time that false memories have been observed in non-human animals. Researchers from Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) tested to see if bumblebees would confuse merged versions of patterns that had previously rewarded them with food, with the ones they had actually seen. They found that if they’d previously been shown a flower with black rings and then a yellow one, that they would later seek food rewards from a flower with yellow rings on it. This incorrect merging of long-term memories in bumblebees is similar to some types of misremembering information that have previously only been observed in humans. The researchers think that such memory errors are probably common in animals whose lifestyle involves regularly juggling multiple memories. Professor Lars Chittka, from QMUL’s School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, said: ‘That people form false memories is well understood but it has never been seen in other animals before. ‘There are a lot of similarities between our own memories and those of other animals. ‘The more we know about the way that memory works in the animal kingdom the more we’ll be able to understand our own memory and the problems we have with it.’ He monitored the activity of these cells when the mice explored an ‘arena’ using electrodes, isolating the cell that fired in a certain arena location. While the mice slept, they monitored the creature’s brain activity and when the specific place cell fired, an electrode stimulated the brain areas linked to reward. When the mice woke up, they immediately scurried to the location that was linked to the rewarding feeling, showing that a new pleasant memory of the place had been formed by the scientists. While this is the first time a conscious memory has been implanted during sleep, experts have already managed to create subconscious associations in the minds of sleeping people – so that smokers associate cigarettes with the smell of rotten eggs, for example. Experts think that if subconscious learning has been forced on the mice while they slept, they would have explored the area in a more random way, instead of heading straight to the place they associated with reward. ‘The mouse develops a goal-directed behaviour to go towards the place,’ Dr Benchenane said. ‘It proves that it's not an automatic behaviour. What we create is an association between a particular place and a reward that can be consciously accessed by the mouse.’ He thinks it could take years for the technique to be adapted to implant different kinds of memories such as skills, for example, but hopes that it could be developed to alter traumatic memories in people. He believes that positive thoughts could be attached to negative memories to stop people having nightmares or dwelling on upsetting events. ‘If you can identify where in the brain a person is reactivating a phobia-associated experience, you might be able to create a positive association,’ he said. The study was published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.

    Officials at a central Georgia Air Force base have backed down from banning guards from telling visitors to 'have a blessed day.' A man who identified himself as an active duty military member posted on the Military Religious Freedom Foundation website that Robins personnel have told him to have a blessed day more than a dozen times in the past two weeks. The man wrote 'I am an active-duty Air Force member/employee currently assigned to Robins Air Force Base, Georgia for the purpose of training. Changes: Officials at a central Georgia Air Force base have backed down from banning guards from telling visitors to 'have a blessed day' (file photo) 'I have been entering through what is known as the "Russell Gate" since the 23rd of February. 'On no less than 15 occasions over the last two weeks, I have been greeted by the military personnel at the gate with the phrase "Have a blessed day." 'This greeting has been expressed by at least 10 different Airmen ranging in rank from A1C to SSgt. 'I found the greeting to be a notion that I, as a non-religious member of the military community should believe a higher power has an influence on how my day should go.' The organization's president, Mikey Weinstein, said on the group's website that he spoke with base officials and was told that staff would no longer use the greeting. Weinstein said base officials told him that gate guards will now say 'have a nice day' instead. After initially banning the greeting, base officials said Thursday evening that further review showed it doesn't violate Air Force standards.

    The European Tour will look to stage the Madeira Islands Open later in the year after it was cancelled due to bad weather on Sunday. The tournament had already been reduced to 36 holes for the second year in succession, but torrential rain meant no play was possible in the second and final round at Santo da Serra. Keith Waters, chief operating officer of the European Tour, said: 'The Madeira Islands Open - Portugal - BPI is a hugely important event for The European Tour so it is disappointing for everyone concerned that we have been forced to cancel this week. Bad weather forced the Madeira Islands Open to be cancelled by officials on Sunday . 'We share a very strong relationship with the hosts and sponsors, so we are already in discussions with the club and the sponsors to reschedule the event for another week in this year's Race to Dubai schedule. 'We must now make every effort to make sure that the Madeira Islands Open takes place this year and that together we can show the world the true potential of this great event and this beautiful island.' Winds gusting up to 47 miles per hour meant no play had been possible on Thursday, while further strong winds on Friday caused a delay of almost two hours before rain ended play early. The European Tour event had already been reduced to 36 holes before Sunday's cancellation . Officials and greenkeepers tried their best to prepare the course for play but the conditions prevailed . Half of the field had yet to complete their rounds when play was abandoned for the day at 6pm and heavy rain which flooded the course caused further disruption on Saturday. With yet more bad weather forecast for Sunday, the decision was taken to make it a 36-hole event, with the top 65 and ties due to play the final round in a shotgun start at 8am. Denmark's JB Hansen held the clubhouse lead on four under par, one shot ahead of a group of eight players including England's Andrew Marshall and Scotland's Peter Whiteford, with the entire field separated by just six shots. It is thought to be the first European Tour event to be cancelled due to bad weather since the Compaq European Grand Prix at Slaley Hall in 1998. European Tour officials will look to reschedule the event for later in the year . Tournament director Jose Maria Zamora said: 'Unfortunately we had 60mm of rain overnight and throughout Sunday and the course became totally unplayable. That made it impossible to start and finish the second round today. 'That would have put us into Monday and we had already been issued a warning for very strong winds on Monday which would again have made the course unplayable. 'We have been very unfortunate with the weather this week but we are hoping to reschedule and show the true potential of the island.'

    The fate of Flight FU 9525 that was deliberately crashed into the Alps has chilling similarities to a number of other aircraft  believed to have been downed by flight crew. Germanwings pilot Andreas Günter Lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit before ploughing the Airbus A320 into the mountain at more than 400mph, killing all 150 on board. The  final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by French prosecutors who said Lubitz's sole aim was to 'destroy the plane'. It echoes a number of recent aviation tragedies and could explain what happened to flight MH370 - which vanished last March while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board.

Other pilots believed to be responsible for fatal air crashes include Herminio dos Santos Fernandes, who was captain of Moza LAM flight 470 that crashed in Namibia in November 2013. Air crash investigators think the Embraer 190 jet was flown into the ground by the captain after his copilot went to the toilet, killing all 27 passengers and six crew. Fernandes was believed to have had serious personal problems at the time of his death. When his co-pilot went to the toilet, flight data information recovered from the scene found that Fernandes manually changed the aircraft's altitude from 38,000 feet to almost 600 feet below ground level. He also pushed the aircraft's throttles back to idle and selected the jet's maximum operating speed. Other pilots believed to be responsible for fatal air crashes include Herminio dos Santos Fernandes, who was captain of Moza LAM flight 470 that crashed in Namibia in November 2013. Above, the wreckage of the plane . Chillingly, the cockpit voice recorder picked up the sound of the co-pilot pounding on the door, similar to Captain Patrick Sondenheimer's attempts to regain access to the flight deck. It emerged today that co-pilot Lubitz made similar changes to his autopilot system - entering a new target altitude of just 96ft moments before the crash. The first relief officer of an EgyptAir flight was blamed when the aircraft crashed into the Atlantic approximately 30 minutes after leaving John F Kennedy Airport in New York on October 31, 1999. The Boeing 767-366 had 14 crew and 203 passengers on board. The National Transport Safety Board who investigated the disaster blamed the crash on the flight's relief first officer. The first relief officer of an EgyptAir flight was blamed when the aircraft crashed into the Atlantic some 30 minutes after leaving John F Kennedy Airport in New York in 1999. Above, debris from the downed plane . Captain Gamil al-Batouti said he would relieve the current pilot - even though he wasn't due on the flight deck for a further three hours. The co-pilot remained with al-Batouti, but when the co-pilot went for a toilet break, the aircraft went into a steep dive and crashed into the sea, killing everyone on board. The cockpit flight recorder heard al-Batouti claim in Arabic 'I place my fate in the hands of God' before the aircraft hit the ocean. El-Batouty even shut down the aircraft's engines, which prevented his co-pilot from saving the aircraft. According to the NTSB 'the probable cause of the crash of EgyptAir flight 990 was the airplane's departure from normal cruise flight and subsequent impact with the Atlantic Ocean as a result of the relief first officer's flight control inputs. 'The reason for the relief first officer's actions was not determined.' In December 1997, a Boeing 737 with 97 passengers and seven crew crashed into the Musi River in southern Sumatra, Indonesia. The NTSB investigated this crash as it involved a US-built aircraft and determined that the jet crashed due the 'direct flight control inputs' of the pilot, probably the captain. However, in both cases, Egyptian and Indonesian authorities do not accept that either of their pilots would have deliberately crashed their own aircraft.

    Royal Bank of Scotland provoked fury last night after handing out lavish bonuses – including an £859,000 windfall to its former boss. The State-backed lender’s annual pay report showed 110 staff received more than 1million euros (£720,000) last year, despite it racking up a £3.5billion loss. This marked its seventh consecutive annual loss since the financial crisis, when it was rescued with a £46billion bailout from taxpayers. Still on the books: Stephen Hester, left with a Warwickshire Hunt,  is set to pocket a £1million bonus from the Royal Bank of Scotland - one of around 70, £1million-plus, payments in 2014 . One of the biggest winners was former chief executive Stephen Hester, who pocketed £859,000 from a long-term bonus awarded in 2012. He handed in his resignation in June 2013, after being pushed out by Chancellor George Osborne. Last night the awards were branded ‘excessive’ and ‘unacceptable’, with campaigners criticising Mr Osborne for failing to stamp out fat-cat pay at RBS. To avoid a new pay row, current chief executive Ross McEwan waived his entitlement to a £1million fixed shares allowance introduced last year to bolster his basic pay package and dodge the EU bonus cap. This restricted his total pay for 2014 to £1.85million. Mr McEwan has also waived his £1million allowance for this year. But yesterday it emerged he could still receive up to £3.9million for 2015, including a long-term shares award of up to £1.6million that will pay out for several years. Warning: Boss Ross McEwan admitted it could be several years until taxpayers finally get their money back after seven consecutive losses . He will also receive a £1.5million ‘golden hello’ shares payment in August to compensate him for bonuses he forfeited when he left his previous job at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in 2012. Finance chief Ewen Stevenson received £3.1million last year, including a similar £1.9million ‘golden hello’ payment – this time for giving up for his old job at Credit Suisse. Last night Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury select committee said the awards were ‘unacceptable’. He added: ‘Here is a bank that’s not doing very well that the taxpayer owns and has underwritten, so why should these few not very successful bankers get paid so much money?’ The boss of RBS’s so-called ‘bad bank’ also hit the jackpot as separate filings to the stockmarket revealed he received a £2million shares windfall yesterday. Rory Cullinan, who is responsible for getting rid of the lender’s most toxic loans, was among seven senior figures to pocket a total of £5.5million from bonuses awarded in previous years. The generous payout for Mr Cullinan is particularly sensitive as he is responsible for shrinking the investment bank. There are fears that up to 14,000 jobs could be at risk. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, criticised Mr Osborne for not doing more to curb pay at RBS, which is still 79 per cent owned by taxpayers. He said: ‘Ultimately pay deals need to be approved by shareholders, and at RBS that includes taxpayers. In the money: RBS, which is based in Edinburgh, pictured, has paid £7.6bn in bonuses since it was bailed out . ‘The Chancellor needs to be far more engaged in the process than he is now, and ask the board to justify these salaries. ‘Until the bank is able to stand on its own two feet, rather than being propped up by taxpayers, it should show more restraint on pay.’ Mr Osborne has admitted he made a mistake by not radically shrinking its investment bank when the Coalition came to office in 2010. He was convinced by the bank’s former management, including Mr Hester, that it could trade its way out of trouble. ‘I certainly regret that,’ Mr Osborne told the Financial Times. ‘I did what I could to correct it.’ Mr Osborne also said he would look to start selling off RBS as quickly as possible after the election, but admitted this could take years. Before the 2008 financial crisis, Royal Bank of Scotland was one of the largest and most aggressive banks in the world. The bank was founded in Edinburgh in 1727, but by the end of the 20th century it was a major player in the City of London too as the UK capital became the world's leading financial centre. RBS sealed its place at the top table of British banking in 2000 when it bought NatWest, which dates back to 1650 and was considered one of the 'Big Four' retail banks in the UK. Fred Goodwin, right, became chief executive of RBS the following year and pioneered a gung-ho expansion strategy with resources poured into its investment banking division. One of the biggest deals came when RBS joined a consortium to buy Dutch bank ABN Amro for £49billion, which was later revealed as a major overvaluation. With the advent of the 2007 credit crunch and subsequent global financial turmoil, RBS was exposed as being dangerously indebted and unable to meet its obligations. The Labour Government felt it had no option but to step in, and in October 2008 it took a 57 per cent stake in the bank in return for £37billion of new capital. As the bank's losses spiralled and it required even more bail-out money, the state share of the firm rose to 82 per cent. It is now at 79 per cent. Much of the blame for RBS's troubles was attributed to Goodwin, who was forced to resign and subsequently stripped of the knighthood he had received in 2004.

    A group of writers are challenging the notion that becoming a parent is the key to a fulfilling and happy existence in a bold new anthology of essays, which explores each contributor’s conscious decision to forgo having children. Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed: Sixteen Writers on the Decision Not to Have Kids was edited by Los Angeles-based author Meghan Daum, 45, who curated the essays of 16 writers, including Lionel Shriver, Sigrid Nunez, Kate Christensen, Elliott Holt, Geoff Dyer and Tim Kreider, for her new book, which is slated for release on Tuesday. But the anthology doesn't take jabs at those who've decided to have children, rather it takes a look at how others have come to the decision that parenthood is not for them in a culture that worships parenthood. Being honest: Meghan Daum edited 16 writers' essays about their decision to forgo having children in her new book Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed: Sixteen Writers on the Decision Not to Have Kids . Just the two of us: Ms Daum, who doesn't have children, posed for this selfie with her husband . 'These essays have so many people talking about the ways that they do have relationships with kids, nieces or nephews or kids that they mentor,' Ms Daum told Flavorwire. She added: 'You’ve heard the cliché "it takes a village", but there are so many ways of being a responsible villager.' The writers who contributed to the book candidly explained about how they came to the decision to live a child-free existence without judgement - which is a refreshing take on a unnecessarily controversial choice that is often met with confusion and criticism. For her book, Ms Daum sought out the perspective of both men and women, although a majority of the essays in the collection are from female writers. 'I think we could be wary of the assumption that parenthood is the only way to be an adult,' Ms Daum told the outlet, noting that  'it's less taboo to say, "I'm a shallow person" than to say that this isn't for me.' Major debut: Ms Daum's new collection of essays will be published on Tuesday . While most conversations about parenting revolve around how women 'can have it all,' this book suggests that maybe they don't want to - or even need to. Ms Daum first thought about sharing the stories of childless adults from a variety of professions and walks of life, but she chose to curate her book with essays from writers because of their ability to 'interpret the world' in a responsible way. Most of the writers featured in the anthology are over the age of 30, Ms Daum said she 'did not have an age cutoff', but noted that it would be difficult to have someone in her twenties make a public declaration that she would never have children. Ms Daum wrote about her own choice not to have children in an essay titled Difference Maker, which appeared The Unspeakable: And Other Subjects of Discussion, her collection of persona essays that was published last year. 'After more than a decade of being told that I’d wake up one morning at age 30 or 33 -or, God forbid, 40 - to the ear-splitting peals of my biological clock, I would still look at a woman pushing a stroller and feel no envy at all, only relief that I wasn’t her,' she recalled in Difference Maker. Throughout the essay, Ms Daum recounted getting pregnant, miscarrying the baby and subsequently deciding that she didn't want to be a mother. In her new book, Ms Daum doesn't touch upon her own life with children beyond the introduction. 'I did feel that I had said all I needed to say,' she told Flavorwire about her previous work.

    (CNN)John Isner could not keep the United States in the Davis Cup on Sunday, so it was likely small consolation that his incredible tennis milestone remained unbeaten. While the American lost to Andy Murray in Scotland, putting Great Britain into the quarterfinals of the prestigious teams event, halfway across the world an absorbing battle was playing out between two of South America's most bitter rivals. In the end it didn't come close to matching Isner's 11-hour marathon against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon in 2010, but the fourth rubber in the clash between Argentina and Brazil made its own piece of history. For six hour and 43 minutes, Leonardo Mayer and Joao Souza contested the second-longest singles match in tennis history -- and third longest of any format after a seven-hour doubles clash between Switzerland and the Czech Republic in 2013. Mayer eventually triumphed, after his 11th match point, winning 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-5) 5-7 5-7 15-13 in front of a delirious home crowd in Buenos Aires to send the tie to a deciding rubber. It set the scene for Federico Delbonis to take on Brazil's Thomaz Bellucci in the decider -- with the winner to earn a clash with Novak Djokovic's Serbia, a 5-0 victor over Balkan rival Croatia. Delbonis had won the first set 6-3 when play was halted for the day due to bad light. The match will resume on Monday. Meanwhile, back in Glasgow, the British team celebrated after earning a home quarterfinal clash with France on July 17-19, the weekend after the completion of Wimbledon. "It was an incredible experience," said world No. 5 Murray, who beat Isner 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 7-6 (7-4) in two and a half hours to give his team a 3-1 lead and ensure a repeat of the result of last year's first-round clash between the two nations. "Playing in front of a home crowd is a bit more pressured, especially today, but I managed to fight my way through the first set and played really well after that." It was the second defeat of the tie for the big-serving Isner, who lost a five-hour five-setter against James Ward on Friday. The Swiss, without leading players Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka, crashed out at the first hurdle with a 3-2 defeat in Belgium. Canada makes their way into the quarterfinals for the second time in three years after beating Japan 3-2. Vasek Pospisil led the tie-break victory by defeating Go Soeda in straight sets on Sunday. Canada will face Belgium in July, after Wimbledon concludes. France, beaten by Switzerland in last year's final, went through after beating Germany 3-2 -- losing both of Sunday's meaningless singles rubbers having already secured victory in the doubles 24 hours earlier. Australia conquered three-time champion Czech Republic, a semifinalist last year, with Bernard Tomic clinching victory in the fourth rubber against Lukas Rosol. Seeking a 29th title, but first since 2003, the Australians will next host Kazakhstan -- which defeated Italy 3-2 as Aleksandr Nedovyesov overcame Fabio Fognini in a five-set decider after trailing 2-1.

Summary target: 
    Leonardo Mayer beats Joao Souza in longest Davis Cup singles match .
Argentine wins in six hours 43 minutes -- third-longest in tennis history .

    One group of supporters will ride in a Hummer 130 miles to London, two special ales have hit the market and a song has entered the charts alongside the likes of Coldplay. The mayor ranks the occasion higher than Noddy Holder receiving the freedom of the borough. Walsall are at Wembley on Sunday for the first time in their 127-year history, taking on Bristol City in the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy final, and fans are already celebrating. ‘I’ll be a 55-year-old kid,’ says Supporters Trust secretary Steve Davies. ‘To actually make it to the home of English football is something special.’ At 3.30pm, Walsall will happily exit a group of Football League teams never to have played at Wembley, leaving behind Accrington Stanley, Crawley Town and Hartlepool United. Walsall's Tom Bradshaw celebrates with supporters after booking their place in the JPT final at Wembley . They have come close four times. They lost to Bournemouth and Millwall in area finals of the same competition in 1998 and 1999. In 1984 they succumbed 4-2 over two legs to a Liverpool side featuring Ian Rush and Alan Hansen in their Milk Cup semi-final, and they were beaten by Crewe in the 1993 Third Division play-off semi. They did reach the 2001 Division Two play-off final against Alan Pardew’s Reading — but with Wembley under reconstruction, their 3-2 victory took place at the Millennium Stadium. That day in Cardiff, 15,000 fans showed up. Nearly 30,000 are making the trip to England’s capital, around seven times Walsall’s average home gate. ‘It’s unprecedented,’ says Walsall chief executive Stefan Gamble. ‘We’ve never had to deal with demand on this level. It has given the club, town, and supporters a real lift and captured the imagination. ‘For a club of our size it makes a significant impact on the manager’s playing budget for next season. This one match will generate more revenue than all our home games put together. It’s huge.’ Manager Dean Smith (centre) hailed the 'amazing achievement' admitting pride at getting Walsall to Wembley . Smith is the fourth longest-serving league manager behind Arsene Wenger, Paul Tisdale and Karl Robinson . More than 70,000 tickets have been sold, making the match the biggest in England this weekend and likely bettered only by El Clasico for attendance in Europe. Dean Smith, the fourth longest-serving league manager behind Arsenal’s Arsene Wenger, Exeter’s Paul Tisdale and Karl Robinson at MK Dons, has succeeded where many others have failed. ‘It’s an amazing achievement, especially when I think of the calibre of some of the managers who have been here before me,’ Smith says. ‘I feel very proud.’ The run began last October at Rochdale. Davies was among the 102 ‘hardy souls’ in attendance when Mathieu Manset scored the winner, his only goal for Walsall. He has since joined Cheltenham. There was then a slender victory over Sheffield United, cup conquerors of four Premier League teams in two seasons, and a penalty shootout win over Tranmere in the area semi-final. Preston were favourites in the area final but Walsall won the first leg at Deepdale 2-0 through late goals from Anthony Forde and Tom Bradshaw, aged 21 and 22. James Baxendale is carried by fans on the pitch at Banks' Stadium after a 2-0 aggregate win over Preston . Bradshaw is congratulated by supporters at the end of the 0-0 draw with Preston North End in January . ‘The second leg was fraught,’ says Davies. ‘We tend to be a little fatalistic as Walsall fans. Even at 2-0 we wouldn’t actually believe it was happening until the fat lady sang. We’d been to the area final twice before and cocked it up.’ The match at the Banks’s Stadium ended goalless in front of 10,038 fans — but chairman Jeff Bonser was not among them, having been in self-imposed exile from home matches for close to five years. Bonser, who took control of Walsall in 1992, stopped going in the face of fierce criticism from fans over his running of the club, having decided his presence would undermine performances. He will be at Wembley, though. ‘He comes into the club every day during the week and still fully supports the club both financially and morally,’ says Gamble. ‘He is as keen as anyone to see us win.’ Former players will be in the stands, too. Watford striker Troy Deeney, who scored 27 goals in 136 games for Walsall, visited his old manor on Wednesday to buy his ticket and Mark Rees, who played in that League Cup tie against Liverpool 31 years ago, will be there. Davies, meanwhile, has booked a Hummer for the drive down. ‘We’re doing it properly,’ he laughs. A young Walsall supporter celebrates after the club reached the final of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy . Many fans will have supped either (or both) of the ales produced in recognition. The Backyard Brewhouse, the only brewery in Walsall, has been pumping Super Saddlers beer to local pubs in recent weeks and the Supporters’ Trust have a limited number of bottles of their own offering, which features a picture of Forde’s goal from the Preston game on the label. Walsall FC Go To Wembley, a song by local band The Assist, is riding high in the iTunes ‘alternative’ music chart, sparring with tracks by Coldplay and the Arctic Monkeys. ‘It’s not a singalong, they’re an indie band. The lads are chuffed,’ says Davies. The town has been painted red. Literally. A famous concrete hippo in the centre has received a splash of club colours. ‘There have been some memorable events recently but this will be the highlight whether we win or lose,’ says councillor Pete Smith, the mayor. ‘The second is when we gave Noddy Holder, a Walsall lad, freedom of the borough.’ Come on feel the noise.

    Walsall take on Bristol City at Wembley Johnstone's Pain Trophy final .

    (CNN)While Boston and other New England cities have suffered through their snowiest seasons, other parts of the country have some unexpected good news to go along with the record-breaking winter conditions. All that cold air and a stuck weather pattern are keeping tornadoes to historic lows so far this year. March is typically a transitional month, where warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico collides with cold Arctic air to produce severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. This year, however, the jet stream pattern responsible for all the cold air and snow in the East remains stuck in more of a winter mode. "We're in a persistent pattern that suppresses severe weather, and the right ingredients -- moisture, instability and lift -- (have yet to come together)," said Greg Carbin, the Warning Coordination Meteorologist with the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. The group is responsible for issuing the tornado and severe thunderstorm watches that warn the public of impending severe weather. So far this year it's been extremely quiet. By this time in mid-March the center would have issued 52 tornado watches nationwide. This year they have issued a paltry four. Both January and February were well below normal. March has been even quieter.  At a time where the tornado season usually ramps up considerably, there has not been a single report this month of a tornado. "We are in uncharted territory with respect to the lack of severe weather" Carbin said. In fact if we make it through the entire month of March without any tornado reports it would be a first, according to the center. There have been around 20 tornadoes reported since January 1, well below the 10-year average of 130 for the period from the beginning of the year until mid-March. This year comes on the heels of what was has been a welcome lull of tornadoes across the United States the past several years.  In 2014, we ended the year with a count of 881, well below the average of 1,253. Meteorologists don't fully understand why we have seen the recent drop in tornadoes, but one possible answer is the development of El Nino, a warming in the equatorial Pacific, which can influence weather patterns globally. Recent studies point to lower tornado counts in the United States during these events. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently said that a weak El Nino had developed. So while all agree this is good news so far this year, it is clear that it is no guarantee that the rest of the season will remain this quiet. Weather patterns can change quickly. In 1984, for instance, there was a very similar slow start through mid-March and the number of tornadoes ended up well above average by the end of June, according to data from the storm center. It's also important to note that even in years where the tornado counts are low, you can still have very violent tornadoes -- 2013 being a perfect example. The year ended being roughly 30% below normal for the number of tornadoes, yet included some of the strongest tornadoes on record. The twisters in Moore and El Reno, Oklahoma, occurred in May of that year with devastating results. Tornadoes Fast Facts .

Summary target: 
    There have been only four tornado watches in 2015 .
El Nino might be helping keep the numbers down .
Slow start doesn't mean it will be quiet for entire season .

Summarized text: 
    The weather pattern is causing the cold air and snow to fall. This year's tornado watches have been issued nationwide - but it'll be quieter this month, experts say in March a few days after Hurricane Sandy if we make it through without any reports of neominous tornado warnings.

    A Nigerian woman filed for divorce from her husband because his penis was too big, according to media reports. Aisha Dannupawa, a housewife and mother-of-three, asked for her marriage to husband Ali Maizinari to be dissolved due to his large manhood. Their divorce was granted after just one week of marriage in a Islamic Sharia court in Nigeria's Zamfara State. Decision: The court in Zamfara State, Nigeria, granted the divorce. It was the first state in the country to introduce Sharia law . She told the court she had married Maizinari after her first marriage failed. As part of the local tradition, before settling into her husband's home the bride was invited to move into his parents' house. But it was only when the couple first had sex she claimed that the trauma began. 'When he came, we had sex but the experience was a nightmare. Instead of enjoying the sex, it turned out to be something else, because his penis was too big,' she told the court, according to Nigeria's Tribune. After their first unsuccessful attempt at making love, she took medication given to her by her mother. 'I told my mother the experience but she told me to endure and that with time, I will be able to cope. She then gave me some drugs,' she said to Nigerian media. According to Dannupawa, the couple had sex again but it was 'too much to bear' and the couple concluded that no drug could help their sex life or their marriage. Maizinari did not deny the accusation and told the court he was willing to dissolve the union if his dowry and money spent during the courtship was paid back. The state of Zamfara is in the north-west of the country and is approximately 500 miles away from Lagos, Nigeria's capital. It was the first state to introduce Islamic law. The average length of an erect penis is 5.2 inches (13.12 cm), according to a report released yesterday. Length: Experts plotted graphs showing the size distribution of the length of the average penis when flaccid, flaccid and stretched and erect. The graph above shows average penis length of men - in centimetres - in each percentile . Tthe average length of a flaccid penis is 3.6 inches (9.16 cm) and 5.2 inches (13.24 cm) when flaccid but stretched. And when it comes to girth, the average erect circumference was 4.6 inches (11.66 cm) and 3.7 inches (9.31 cm) when flaccid. The British research also found there was a small correlation between the erect length of a penis and a man's height. Girth: The researchers also plotted a nomogram showing the size distribution of the girth of the average penis. The graph shows the average penis girth of men in each percentile - again in centimetres .
