    They have not been photographed together since their 2012 divorce so it was not much of a surprise when it was reported on Wednesday that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes are not on speaking terms. The next day TMZ added more to their story, explaining why the the 52-year-old Mission: Impossible superstar and the 36-year-old Batman Begins beauty are not fond of each other. 'Tom feels betrayed by Katie,' a source said adding that Katie felt 'he sucked the life out of her.' Their 'bad feelings' explained: Tom Cruise felt 'betrayed' by Katie Holmes while she thought he 'drained' her, according to a Thursday report from TMZ; here they are pictured in May 2011 . Katie filed for divorce from Tom Cruise in 2012 just before his 50th birthday in July. Afterwards he hinted he was blindsided. The mother of Suri - aged eight - quickly found her own apartment in New York City and the divorce proceedings were wrapped up in record time. The site explained that since they posted their first article, sources called them up and added more kindling to the fire. They were once a close family unit: Katie, 36, filed for divorce from Tom, 52,  in 2012 just before his 50th birthday in July; afterwards he hinted he was blindsided. Here they are pictured in October 2011 . TMZ claimed one of those source is from the Church Of Scientology and that insider explained the Church is not involved in their feud. 'Well-placed sources with the Church tell TMZ, Katie was NOT declared a Suppressive Person. What's interesting, we're told Katie actually thinks she's been declared one ... but she hasn't,' wrote the site. It was then explained, 'An SP stands for several things, including people who disavow the Church. The Church has a procedure for declaring people SPs. Once they're declared an SP, people in the Church are told not to associate with them.' It was also stated clearly again that the two stars 'are not at war over the Church Of Scientology' and that they don't talk because 'they have an intense dislike for one another.' Earlier it was reported that Tom and Katie don't even talk about Suri. Rather they leave that up to intermediaries. 'They want nothing to do with each other to the point they don't speak to one another, even about Suri,' a source told the site. Their only child: 'They want nothing to do with each other to the point they don't speak to one another, even about Suri,' a source told the site; here Suri, aged eight, is pictured with Suri in June 2012 . Even planning visitations and discussing how the little girl should be raised is done through others, it was alleged. 'There is no desire on either Tom's or Katie's part to mend fences,' it was added. It was claimed that Tom has not seen Suri 'in months' because he has been shooting Mission: Impossible 5 in London. No turning back?: Tom and Katie have 'no desire to mend fences,' it was alleged; here they are seen in December 2011 leaving The Meatball Shop (left) and in February 2012 at the Vanity Fair Oscar party (right) They had the wedding of the year: Katie became Mrs Tom Cruise in Italy in November 2006 . With a rich pal: The couple in February 2006 with James Packer in Sydney Harbour . But his team has insisted many times since his 2012 divorce from Holmes that the Top Gun star does make time for his child and sees her often. Reps for Cruise have not returned calls to Daily Mail. TMZ insisted that Katie is upset the Oblivion actor doesn't see their child more. The site added he has wrapped his film and will be back in LA soon, where Katie and Suri now reside. New love talk: On the Wednesday cover of UsWeekly, it was claimed she has 'sleepovers' at Foxx's house . She moved on: It has been claimed by People, UsWeekly and TMZ that the 36-year-old actress is now dating Jamie Foxx, 47, who used to be friends with Cruise . Katie is raising their daughter in the same Calabasas neighborhood where Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian live. The former Dawson's Creek star is in LA to film her arc on TV's Ray Donovan. Holmes does not seem too concerned about these reports. Very early on Wednesday morning she posted to Instagram a video of herself in dance class with a male instructor. Her caption read, 'Kicking into Wednesday! Have a great day!' In early March the Miss Meadows star shared the quote from Nelson Mandela, 'May your choices reflect your hopes not your fears.' At work: The Ohio native on the set of her show Ray Donovan with Liev Schreiber in February .

    Katie, 36, and Tom, 52, have 'bad feelings' after 2012 divorce .
He feels she 'betrayed' him while she thinks 'he drained her'

    An investigation has been launched after an Army platoon was accused of racially abusing its own soldiers in an event known as 'Racial Thursdays'. The sickening tradition allegedly has been taking place among soldiers in the 2nd Platoon, C Company, 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment at Fort Wainwright, Alaska. The Army Times first reported on the racist behavior after several soldiers, who wished to remain anonymous, came forward. One staff sergeant, who is black, told the newspaper this week: 'When I first got to my unit, someone said we should do ''Racial Thursdays'' because it's been a tradition. 'It's something they made up where you can say any racist remark you want without any consequences. The platoon sergeant said no, but the s*** is still going on.' A platoon based at Fort Wainwright in Alaska (pictured) has been placed under investigation after it emerged that they were holding 'Racial Thursdays' - when any racist remark was allowed without consequence. Another soldier of lower rank verified the story but also asked to remain anonymous. He said that a Latino colleague was badgered with racial slurs for hours until he almost got into a fight with another soldier. 'Racial Thursdays' were reportedly taking place at the same unit in Alaska where Pvt Danny Chen (pictured) once belonged. The solider, 19, committed suicide in 2011 after what investigators said was weeks of abuse and racial slurs . The platoon leader allegedly encouraged the practice 'to build morale and camaraderie', The Army Times reported. 'Racial Thursdays' have allegedly been taking place at the same unit where Private Danny Chen once belonged, The Army Times reported. The 19-year-old infantryman from New York City shot himself in a guard tower in southern Afghanistan in October 2011 after what investigators described as weeks of physical abuse, humiliation and racial slurs. The young soldier endured attacks on a daily basis for six weeks from fellow soliders who singled him out for being Chinese-American. He was taunted with the slurs 'gook', 'chink' and 'dragon lady', according to reports, beaten and put on excessive guard duty to the point of exhaustion. The day of his death he was made to crawl 100 yards over gravel carrying equipment while rocks were thrown at him by fellow soldiers. In December  2011, the Army charged eight soldiers with various crimes relating to Chen's death. Four soldiers were ultimately court-martialed. In a statement to Daily Mail Online, the U.S. Army in Alaska said: 'We are already aware of these allegations, as an informal complaint was made through command channels about this alleged behavior. The command has assigned an investigating officer and the investigation is ongoing. The command is extremely sensitive to any complaints that involve equal opportunity or discrimination and will investigate every allegation. 'It's important to emphasize that these allegations are just that. They're allegations, and that's what the investigation has been assigned to find out, exactly what happened and if anything happened. 'Based on the results of that inquiry, and if the evidence supports it, the commander, usually the brigade commander, can elect to conduct a 15-6 investigation. 'Treating all soldiers with dignity and respect is something this command takes extremely seriously, and when there are any indications that those values are not being followed, the command will absolutely make inquiries, conduct appropriate investigations and take action as necessary.'

    Lionel Messi left  Pep Guardiola applauding in the Nou Camp stands, the football world entertained and James Milner on the turf on Wednesday night as he pulled off a stunning nutmeg on the unfortunate Manchester City midfielder. The Barcelona superstar made a habit of performing the skill during his side's 1-0 Champions League win, mesmerising both the 92,000 crowd and City players including Brazilian Fernandinho. After Messi's breathtaking display, Sportsmail traces the origins of nutmegging and counts down 10 of the best of all time. VIDEO Scroll down to watch nutmegs from Cristiano Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and more . James Milner approaches Barcelona star Lionel Messi during their Champions League tie on Wednesday . Messi slips the ball through Manchester City midfielder Milner's legs at the Nou Camp . Milner slides as Messi nutmegs him and goes the opposite way during their Champions League match . Milner is left on his backside as Messi runs away from the England international with the ball . What is a nutmeg? A nutmeg is the technique of rolling the ball between an opponent's legs, and gains extra acclaim when the attacking player retains possession after performing the trick. Where does the word come from? The origins of the word have long been debated, with the most popular theory being that nutmegs are slang for a rather private area of the male anatomy — a notion put forward by Countdown star Susie Dent, of Dictionary Corner, who on Wednesday night tweeted: 'Nutmegging in football comes from the centuries-old slang 'nutmegs', meaning 'testicles'. In case Messi is ever interested.' However, the use of the word nutmeg to mean leg in Cockney rhyming slang has also been put forward as an explanation, while another claim is that it comes from the practice used in nutmeg exports between America and England in the 18th century, when nutmegs were such a valuable commodity that unscrupulous exporters used to mix wooden replicas into the sacks being shipped across the Atlantic. Crystal Palace's Jason Puncheon puts the ball through the legs of Tottenham's Christian Eriksen this season . Hispanic America - cano, tunel, ordenar, cocina . Other European/Latin and African countries - panna . Germany - tunnel, Beinschuss . France - petit pont . Finland - langet . Ukraine - 25 kopiyok - meaning 25 cents player owes . South Africa - iShibobo . Holland - poorten, panna . Nigeria - O-C - meaning 'oh see' Egypt - kobry . Malaysia and Singapore - ole . Kenya - 'chobo, chobwe . Japan - Matanuki . Iran - lauyee . Brazil - caneta, saia, rolinho . Poland - zalozyc . Hungary - koteny . Malawi - kalulu . Italy - tunnel . Indonesia - kolong . Ethiopia - lochie . Denmark, Sweden and Norway - tunnel . Zambia - pomo . Portugal - cueca, rata . Zimbabwe - deya . Tunisia - adma . Being nutmegged soon came to imply stupidity on the part of the duped victim and cleverness on the part of the trickster. It later caught on in football, implying that the player whose legs the ball had been played through had been tricked, or, nutmegged. The verb nutmegged is listed by the Oxford English Dictionary as 'arising in the 1870s which in Victorian slang came to mean "to be tricked or deceived, especially in a manner which makes the victim look foolish".' In Spanish a nutmeg is known as 'cano' or 'tunel', while many countries around the world have their own unique words to describe the skill. Sportsmail's top 10 nutmegs . 10. John O'Shea on Luis Figo, Manchester United vs Real Madrid, 2003 . That isn't written the wrong way. Honest. Manchester United's utility man gave the Portuguese superstar a taste of his own medicine with this silky piece of skill in a Champions League quarter-final at Old Trafford almost 12 years ago. 9. Fernando Redondo on Henning Berg, Manchester United vs Real Madrid, 2000 . Another Champions League clash between United and Real, another stunning nutmeg. Three years before O'Shea's effort Redondo set up the visitors' winning goal for Raul with a sublime flick through the legs of Berg. 8. Lionel Messi on James Milner, Barcelona vs Manchester City, 2015 . Messi's brilliant piece of skill - one of many on Wednesday night - is only good enough for eighth place on our countdown. The fact Milner came rushing in counts against the Argentine, although leaving the England international on his backside earns him extra points. 7. Ronaldinho on Chievo, AC Milan vs Chievo, 2010 . Some Brazilian magic from Ronaldinho now, as he toys with a helpless Chievo player in Serie A. The former Barca man is renowned for his dribbling skills and they can be seen in full flow in the clip below, which includes an audacious backheel nutmeg. 6. Ryan Giggs on Jason Cundy, Tottenham vs Manchester United, 1992 . The first nutmeg on our countdown which ended with the architect scoring. Giggs pounces on a mistake by Dean Austin, pops the ball through Cundy's legs before rounding goalkeeper Ian Walker to score. Not bad for an 18-year-old. 5. Luis Suarez on Ryan Shotton, Stoke vs Liverpool, 2011 . Similar to Giggs' effort in that it ended with a goal, Suarez showed superb vision to knock the ball past Shotton and create some space for himself. His next touch wasn't bad either, bending his shot into the bottom corner of Thomas Sorensen's net to help Liverpool into the Carling Cup fifth round. 4. Lionel Messi on Emir Spahic, Sevilla vs Barcelona, 2012 . Wednesday night's game against City wasn't the first time Messi has caught the eye with a nutmeg. The little Argentine showed speed, composure and skill against Sevilla as he put the ball through Spahic's legs before delightfully chipping the ball into the back of the net. 3. Ricardo Kishna on Stefano Marzo, Ajax vs Heerenveen, 2014 . One of Ajax's bright young things, Kishna showed exactly why he's destined for a big future with this outrageous touch late last year. The 20-year-old's flicked nutmeg left Marzo stranded and Ajax on the attack. Perfection. 2. Cristiano Ronaldo vs Steven Davis, Northern Ireland vs Portugal, 2013 . A wonderful piece of skill from Ronaldo who first fools Davis with a Cruyff turn before popping the ball in between the Southampton man's legs. The Portuguese also gets a whack but the referee plays advantage as he retains possession with a neat backheel to a team-mate. 1. Juan Roman Riquelme on Mario Yepes, Boca Juniors vs River Plate, 2000 . One of the most talented players of his generation, Riquelme was no stranger to moments of magic on the pitch. Even in a heated Copa Libertadores quarter-final he was cool enough to beat Yepes with a brilliant rolled nutmeg. Class. PS . Touted as the new Neymar, Brazilian youngster Kenedy definitely has the skills to rival his compatriot. The Fluminense forward pulled off this stunning elastico nutmeg against Argentina Under 20s last month, bamboozling his opponent with his quick feet. No wonder Premier League clubs are keeping an eye on him...

Summary target: 
    Lionel Messi showed off his skills in Barcelona's victory on Wednesday .
The little Argentine nutmegged Man City's James Milner and Fernandinho .
Nutmeg is believed to come from the slang 'nutmegs', meaning testicles .
The skill is called 'cano' or 'tunel' in Spanish, while 'panna' is also popular .
Cristiano Ronaldo, Luis Suarez and Ronaldinho all feature in our top 10 .

    Messi performed a nutmeg on Milner during Barcelona's Champions League win at the Nou Camp Stadium in Manchester City last night, meddling Messino and Fernandinho. The skill is used to roll between two legs of an opponent with the ball - which gains extra reclaim when they retain possession after performing it!

    The birth of the forthcoming royal baby, due in April, will be marked with a special £5 coin . A £5 coin will be issued to celebrate the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child. The forthcoming royal baby - due mid to late April - will be fourth in line to the throne and is not expected to ever rule as monarch, but just like older brother Prince George the occasion will be marked with a commemorative coin. The Queen - the baby's great-grandmother - approved the decision at a meeting of the Privy Council at Buckingham Palace on March 19. Thousands of commemorative coins were struck to celebrate the arrival of George in July 2013 and sold out within days. The Royal Mint produced 10,000 solid silver crown-sized £5 coins, which cost £80 each, and 2,013 22 carat gold sovereigns, which cost £800 each. Both featured the prince's namesake St George. Babies born on the same day as George were also entitled to receive one of 2,013 free 'lucky' silver pennies. When George turned one, the occasion was also marked by a commemorative £5 coin - making him the first member of the royal family to have his first birthday honoured with a new UK coin. His christening was also marked with a coin. The coin to mark the new child's birth will be similar to the silver crown-sized piece that marked Prince George's first birthday on July 22, 2014 .

    England could be looking for a new bowling coach for the Ashes after David Saker confirmed he would be returning to his native Australia to coach Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League. Saker, 48, who has been with England for five years, has a six-month termination clause in his ECB contract, which could yet mean he sees out the summer in this country before heading home. But he is keen to move back to Australia sooner rather than later, and also hopes to become head coach of a state side in the first-class Sheffield Shield competition – with Victoria the favourites. England bowling coach David Saker has confirmed his return to Australia with Melbourne Renegades . Saker, pictured speaking to James Anderson, has worked with the England team for the last five years . If the ECB do allow Saker to head home before the Australians arrive to defend the Ashes this summer, that could pave the way for the return of Ottis Gibson, who quit as West Indies coach last year and was Saker's predecessor in the England fast-bowling role. Saker told the Melbourne Age: 'My first three years in the job for English cricket was a bit of a fairytale. But like most things it's hard to keep that form up. We lost some senior players, which made it a little bit harder. 'I'm sure everyone in the Australian camp don't think they can just walk up and win the Ashes. If they think that they've got something very wrong with them, because England in England are always hard to beat.' Saker's exit could open the door for Ottis Gibson, pictured with Anderson in 2007, to return to the role . The 48-year-old, pictured with Chris Woakes, could yet see out the summer with England .

Summary target: 
    David Saker could see out the summer with England before heading home .
The 48-year-old bowling coach has been with England for five years .
Ottis Gibson could return to his former role after quitting West Indies .
Saker will coach Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League .

Summarized text: 
    David Saker has been with England for five years. The 48-years veteran has six months left in his contract a year ago and could see out the summer before heading home to Australia if he is allowed back by law, it will open up door of Ottis Gibson returning to role – who was Sakers predecessor as West Indies coach last season at Melbourne Renegades this summer (with Victoria)

    An unseasonable wildfire driven by strong winds prompted an evacuation of a ski lodge in southern Montana. The blaze a few miles west of the community of Red Lodge had grown to 700 acres by Saturday night, US Forest Service spokesman Jeff Gildehaus said. The fire was first reported on open private land around 12.30pm, but it was driven by winds gusting 35 to 50 mph into the Custer National Forest, where the Red Lodge Mountain Resort ski area is located. It was zero per cent contained as of early Saturday night. A wildfire near the Red Lodge Mountain Resort ski area in southern Montana had grown to 700 acres after being reported at 200 acres earlier on Saturday . Thirteen engines and two fire attack crews had been deployed, according to KTVQ. 'There's snow between the ski area and the fire and the timber. But it's also a solid run of timber from where the fire is to the ski area,' Gildehaus said. 'So it gets up in the trees and starts running the crowns of the trees and it starts advancing toward the ski area.' He said that the decision to evacuate the Red Lodge ski area was made about 2:30 p.m. Saturday as a precautionary move and because there was just one road for firefighters and skiers to use. The evacuations have since been lifted, and Gildehaus said people were free to return to the ski area. He said the winds had eased somewhat and were expected to continue that course through the night. Gildehaus wasn't sure how many people had been evacuated, but he estimated about 500. The resort posted on its Facebook page that guests were safe and being escorted down the mountain by law enforcement. Red Lodge Mountain Resort ski area had an evacuation order on Saturday that was lifted. The US Forest Service said that no structures had been damaged in the blaze thus far (file photo) It plans on being open Sunday. The fire burned around rural homes, but no structures were damaged, Gildehaus said. With still no containment by Saturday night, the blaze had more than tripled from the 200 acres reported earlier in the day. Wildfires in the area at this time of year are unusual, he said. 'But down in the low elevation, there isn't any snow and things are pretty dry,' Gildehaus said. 'We haven't really had any green-up yet where grasses turn green. We got all the dry grass from last year, and things are pretty dry.' The fire actually started on Wednesday after a subdivision's controlled burn, according to the Billings Gazette. Red Lodge Fire Chief Tom Kuntz said that the blaze 'would have been a major fire in the summer,' A rain shower helped firefighters, but Kuntz said that several days would be required to deal with the fire. Traffic on state highways was diverted on Saturday. Other wildfires were reported elsewhere Saturday in Montana and northern Wyoming, leading to the evacuation of a subdivision. The southwestern portion of Montana and northern part of Wyoming are filled by a forest that stretches south to Shoshone and Yellowstone national parks.

Summary target: 
    Blaze at Custer National Forest grew from 200 acres earlier on Saturday .
Evacuation order given at Red Lodge Mountain in Montana later lifted .
Fire zero was per cent contained as of early Saturday night .

Continuing his love affair for Sydney, Hamilton said he would welcome the F1's move to Sydney if a proposed street circuit format gets the go-ahead when the Melbourne contract expires. The British F1 champion arrived in Sydney on Monday before taking in a gig and going sailing on the harbour . 'I have heard of the potential for a street race here and I love street circuits,' Hamilton told the Daily Telegraph. 'Street circuits are the best. For a driver they're the best and it's best for people to get close to — some 300,000 to 400,000 people leaning out of apartment windows. 'I've only been to Sydney a couple of times now but I've seen pictures of the Opera House and it's always so sunny. I really enjoy it when I come here. The weather's always fantastic.'

    Iraq's government is investigating reports that the ancient archaeological site of Khorsabad in northern Iraq has become the latest to be attacked by Islamic State. Adel Shirshab, the country's tourism and antiquities minister, said there are concerns the militants had removed artefacts and blown up the site, located nine miles north-east of Mosul. Saeed Mamuzini, a Kurdish official from Mosul, said militants had already begun demolishing the Khorsabad site on Sunday, citing multiple witnesses. On Friday, the group razed 3,000-year-old Nimrud and on Saturday, they bulldozed 2,000-year old Hatra - both Unesco world heritage sites. Scroll down for video . The foundations of an ancient palace in the Assyrian city of Khorsabad which has reportedly been looted and destroyed by Islamic State militants near the Iraqi city of Mosul . The sculptured stone slabs that once lined the palace walls at Khorsabad are now displayed in museums around the world including these Assyrian winged bulls now housed in the British Museum in London . Other statues of winged bulls from Khorsabad can be found in the Louvre museum in Paris . UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon has called the destruction a 'war crime'. A statement by his spokesman on Sunday night said Mr Ban was 'outraged by the continuing destruction of cultural heritage in Iraq' by ISIS. Khorsabad was constructed as a new capital of Assyria by King Sargon II shortly after he came to power in 721BC and abandoned after his death in 705BC. It features a city wall with a stone foundation and seven gates. Since it was a single-era capital, few objects linked to Sargon II himself were found. However, the site is renowned for shedding light on Assyrian art and architecture. The sculptured stone slabs that once lined the palace walls are now displayed in museums in Baghdad, Paris, London and Chicago. ISIS currently controls about a third of Iraq and Syria. Officials in the northern city of Mosul confirmed militants with the terror group have begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. A file photo shows the temple to the Shamash sun god in Hatra . Iraq's minister of tourism and antiquities said the government was also investigating reports that the ancient archaeological site of Hatra in north west Iraq is being demolished by militants from the Islamic State group . The Sunni extremist group has been campaigning to purge ancient relics they say promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. Yesterday, officials officials  reported the jihadists have begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. It comes after fanatics went on a rampage in the Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, destroying the 3,000 year-old winged statues placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. A video released last week also showed them smashing artefacts in the Mosul museum. In January, the group also burned hundreds of books from the Mosul library and Mosul University, including many rare manuscripts. At a press conference earlier yesterday, Mr Shirshab said they have called for an extraordinary session of the UN Security Council to address the crisis in Iraq. 'The world should bear the responsibility and put an end to the atrocities of the militants, otherwise I think the terrorist groups will continue with their violent acts,' he said. ISIS extremists targeted a museum in Mosul using power drills and sledge hammers to destroy artefacts .

    It was only a small-sided game at the end of a session at Arsenal’s London Colney training ground, but heads were turned when teenage striker Chuba Akpom, called over to join them, cut in from the left flank and curled the ball, side-footed, around the goalkeeper to score. The move echoed a former time and a former forward, as if the ghost of Thierry Henry was still haunting the centre’s pitches with his trademark dribble and finish. Alexis Sanchez came running over to Akpom, leaping around excitedly and shouting ‘Titi, Titi, Titi, Titi!’ Arsenal's teenage striker Chuba Akpom has been compared to club legend Thierry Henry . Thierry Henry was Akpom's idol growing up and the youngster is keen to emulate his success . Akpom (left), walks to training with Arsenal team-mates Theo Walcott, Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck . There is still a long, long way to go until the 19-year-old gets anywhere near close to his idol Henry, but nicknames tend to stick around. ‘One day in training with the first team I scored an Henry-type goal, cutting inside and finishing,’ Akpom tells Sportsmail. ‘I could see Sanchez jumping, he’ s an enthusiastic guy at the best of times and he’s going: “Titi, Titi, Titi, Titi!” ‘The next morning he came to me and said “Titi.” 'Then the next morning he came to me and said “Titi.” I asked: 'hold on is this my new nickname?' That’s how it came about and it’s stuck since then. ‘Now the lads just call me Titi or Thierry Henry - I’ll take that. It’s not a bad comparison to have. ‘He was my idol growing up. Playing for the academy and watching Arsenal’s first team I used to see players like Henry scoring every week and it really inspired me.’ Akpom was born and bred in east London’s Canning Town and joined Arsenal aged six.

Manager Arsene Wenger has been so impressed with his progress the Frenchman has him training with the first team and has included him regularly on the bench this season, featuring several times in the Premier League and FA Cup. Even if the Henry comparisons are premature, there is no denying Akpom is beginning to make his mark where it matters. ‘I’m with the senior team now in the changing room and on the training ground,’ he adds. ‘It’s all about getting familiar with the environment and the players and getting as much game time as I can. ‘A lot of them are international players, a lot are England players; Calum Chambers, Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Theo Walcott, Danny Welbeck, Kieran Gibbs. I look up to them. 'They’ve made it into the England senior team. It’s good to be around them and get good advice.’ Akpom is a right-footed front man but likes to drop out wide to the left flank to torment full-backs. Sound familiar? His is quick and skilful with a sharp finish. Most importantly, he scores goal. For Arsenal youth teams and England Under 15 to Under 20 level, bucketfuls of them.

The teenage striker celebrates after Nacho Monreal converts the winning penalty in a League Cup tie at West Brom last season . ‘People keep telling me having a child is the best feeling,’ he says. ‘I haven’ t had that yet I’m too young, but when I score goals - I’d be surprised if you beat that feeling.’ He cites one of the game’s greatest goal-scorers, the Brazilian Ronaldo, as another idol and closer to home is aiming at the top. But, unlike the lightning runs down the left wing, he understands all of that will come slowly. ‘Wayne Rooney is another player I look up to,’ he explains. ‘He’s the captain of the national team and that’s something I would like to try to do. ‘I’d love to be a captain - of England and Arsenal. Leading by example off the pitch and on it. It would be a dream. ‘Right now, it’s about getting in the squad first. You look at Luke Shaw, see him go to the World Cup last summer, it shows you how fast things can change. ‘Raheem Sterling is a good friend of mine, Ross Barkley; young players are getting their chance. But now it’s about taking it step-by-step. There’s no rush.’ The Together for England Roadshow is a nationwide drive aimed at inspiring current and future Three Lions fans by strengthening the national side’s relationship with local communities.
