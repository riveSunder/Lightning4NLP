    Europes largest budget airline has just been granted approval to develop a transatlantic service between Europe and America. Ryanair, the Ireland-based budget carrier, plans to run services between key European cities and the US with one-way tickets costing from as little as $15. The idea is part of an aggressive growth strategy, connecting airports such as London Stansted and Berlin with New York, Boston and Miami. Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, has received board approval to develop a transatlantic service for budget passengers, with one-way tickets between the US and key European cities costing as little as $15 . The airline first mooted the idea of offering transatlantic flights back in 2008 and board approval comes after the airline has invested 18 months in cleaning up its image and improving customer service. It is believed it could take up to five years to realize the plan, as the airline needs to source appropriate long-haul aircraft for the routes. Last year, Michael O’Leary, the airline’s chief executive, told the Irish Hotels Federation conference in Meath that Ryanair would offer the $15 flights to Boston and New York. However, he admitted that passengers would pay extra for everything from meals to baggage. He said: 'We can make money on 99 cent fares in Europe. Michael O'Leary  previously said the airline has long been looking at long-haul flight plans, but is held back by a lack of aircraft availability . 'Not every seat will be ($15) of course; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats.' In a separate conversation, Mr O'Leary admitted: 'We've had a business plan ready to roll for a transatlantic, low-fares airline. 'The difficulty is, I keep cautioning, is that there's no availability of long-haul aircraft for another four or five years.' Sir Freddie Laker revolutionised air travel with his idea for budget flights between Europe and the US, but his airline failed in 1982 . Ryaniar isn't the only airline to consider offering budget transatlantic flights. Previously, Sir Freddie Laker launched Skytrain in the late Seventies to offer 'no frills' flights to the US, but his carrier Lake Airways failed in 1982. Zoom Airlines tried a similar concept in 2002 but was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2008. More recently, Norwegian has launched its own budget flights between London Gatwick, New York, Boston and Los Angeles from as little as £389 ($415) return.
Summary target: 
    Ryanair is Europe's largest budget airline carrier .
They will now develop a new service to connect Europe with the US .
Plan to run services between London Stansted and Berlin with New York, Boston and Miami .

    David Cameron was forced to defend his decision to announce a sell-by date on his premiership yesterday as senior Tories accused him of trying to anoint George Osborne as his successor. Downing Street was struggling to contain the fallout from the Prime Minister’s extraordinary announcement that May’s general election will be his last. Friends dismissed rumours that Mr Cameron’s wife, Samantha, had asked him to make clear he would not seek a third term if re-elected, while Mr Cameron insisted he had simply given a ‘straight answer to a straight question’ and that most people would think that was a ‘sensible’ thing to do. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured) was forced to defend his decision to announce a sell-by date on his premiership yesterday as senior Tories accused him of trying to anoint George Osborne as his successor . As Labour accused him of ‘arrogance’ for discussing a third election before he wins a second, he insisted he was ‘taking absolutely nothing for granted’. ‘My entire focus is on the next 44 days and the general election that will decide which team runs the country for the next five years,’ Mr Cameron said. But senior MPs warned that pre-announcing a departure before the 2020 election would inevitably undermine his authority if he remained in No 10. It came as Mr Cameron was reminded of his comments to Tony Blair when the former premier announced he was handing over the reins to then-Chancellor Gordon Brown mid-term. ‘Your authority is draining away,’ he told Mr Blair in the Commons in January 2007. ‘The Government can’t plan. Ministers are treading water. They are all waiting for the Chancellor and not listening to you.’ One former shadow minister said that by indicating he will depart in the next Parliament, Mr Cameron appeared to be seeking to head off moves to oust him on May 8 if he falls short of a Commons majority and tries to lead another coalition or a minority government. David Cameron has revealed he will stand down as Prime Minister before 2020 if he wins the next election . Senior MPs warned that pre-announcing a departure before the 2020 election would inevitably undermine his authority if he remained in No 10. Pictured: David Cameron visits a butchers in his Oxfordshire constituency . ‘He may think it will be harder for the men in the grey suits to come knocking when he has said he won’t be going on and on,’ the MP said. ‘The truth is he won’t last five minutes, let alone five years, if he loses again.’ There was particular consternation that Mr Cameron effectively fired the starting gun on a leadership contest by naming three potential successors: Home Secretary Theresa May, London Mayor Boris Johnson and Mr Osborne, the Chancellor. Mrs May and Mr Johnson have long been seen the leading rivals to be the next Tory leader, but Mr Cameron sparked frenzied speculation at Westminster by including his name of Mr Osborne, his closest ally. Since his unpopular Budget of 2012, Mr Osborne’s leadership prospects have been discounted by many. Boris Johnson . Boris Johnson is the favourite among voters to succeed David Cameron, a poll reveals today. But the London Mayor repeatedly refused to say whether he would join a leadership contest. Chancellor George Osborne is thought to be the Prime Minister’s preference to be his successor. But in a ComRes survey for the Daily Mail, Mr Johnson was backed by 31 per cent of voters, ahead of Theresa May on 17 per cent and Mr Osborne on 12 per cent. Support for the Mayor among Tory voters was particularly strong – 36 per cent said he would make the best prime minister, Mr Osborne was on 25 per cent and Mrs May on 18 per cent. Mr Johnson’s strongest backing was among Ukip supporters, at 44 per cent – suggesting he would do the best job of regaining support from the Eurosceptic party. He was also backed by 32 per cent of Labour voters, ahead of Mrs May on 19 per cent, and the Chancellor on 7 per cent. But in an LBC Radio interview yesterday, Mr Johnson dodged questions about his ambitions more than a dozen times. He is bidding to return as an MP in May in the safe seat of Uxbridge, but claimed Mr Cameron’s intervention was ‘no big deal’. ‘All he’s saying is I think obvious and common sense … he doesn’t want to go on and on and on like Mrs Thatcher,’ the Mayor said. ‘To say he’s arrogant or presumptuous to rule [out] a third term seems to be totally bizarre because actually he’s being rather humble and rather straightforward and telling it like it is.’ Asked repeatedly if he would go for the party leadership, Mr Johnson said: ‘I can’t possibly answer that because it’s a long way off. We probably don’t even know the identity of the next leader … It is some baby, unborn.’ Mr Osborne praised Mr Cameron for giving ‘a direct answer’. Mrs May is yet to comment. But the recent turnaround in his popularity as the economy improves has led many MPs to reconsider. Polls suggest Mr Osborne has become the most popular Conservative Treasury spokesman since Nigel Lawson in 1987. ‘Cameron has propelled George Osborne into the top three, quite deliberately,’ said one senior MP. ‘Whether that helps George or not remains to be seen.’ Another former minister said: ‘It’s not what he has said about timing – it’s the list of names. The Parliamentary party doesn’t really want any of them. Theresa May is a cold loner with a following of about two. George has been a good Chancellor of the Exchequer, but people resent his coterie of apparatchiks and think he is ultimately unelectable. Boris is another Bullingdon Club boy who ignored Parliament when he was last in it and lots of people think would be too risky.’ MPs also questioned how Mr Cameron could promise to serve a ‘full second term’ when a new leader would need at least six months to establish themselves before the 2020 election. Some allies of the Prime Minister, however, suggest he could step down as party leader, allowing a contest to take place some months before, while remaining Prime Minister right up until polling day. While this would be unprecedented in modern British political history, it would mirror the American system, where a president serves a fixed second term. Former Tory minister Michael Portillo described Mr Cameron’s announcement as ‘bizarre’. He told the BBC: ‘When you play chess you have to consider the next two moves, and I don’t think he did. There is no point setting off on this wild goose chase in the middle of an election campaign.’ But Defence Secretary Michael Fallon defended the Prime Minister. ‘He made very clear he is standing for a full second term. What happens in 2020 really, I think, doesn’t bother a lot of people,’ he said. ‘If he had said exactly the opposite – that he wanted to go on and on and he wasn’t prepared to answer the question when he was likely to finish – you’d have accused him, quite rightly, of arrogance and wanting term after term.’ A snap poll by ComRes for the Daily Mail found voters are divided over Mr Cameron’s announcement. Some 70 per cent believe Mr Cameron was ‘just being honest’, while 80 per cent say ten years is long enough for any Prime Minister to achieve their plans. Four in ten said he had made himself a lame duck, but the majority – 59 per cent – disagreed. However, 70 per cent said he should be focusing on voters rather than his own job. Four in ten think the next government would be destabilised by a Tory leadership election.

    A popular health blogger who reportedly failed to donate $300,000 in profits to charity has now admitted she was 'wrong' about the extent of her terminal cancer. The Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson, whose app has about 200,000 followers, claims she was 'misdiagnosed' by a doctor after announcing last year that life-threatening cancer had spread to her live, uterus, spleen and blood, The Australian reports. The 26-year-old, who became a social media sensation when she launched her hit lifestyle and recipe app after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, says she feels 'humiliated' after a German medical team's examination led her to announce she was battling a third and fourth cancer. The latest revelations come just a day after it emerged that Ms Gibson may have misled her followers by failing to donate 25 per cent of the profits from The Whole Pantry - totaling $300,000 - to charity, despite promising she would. Scroll down for video . Belle Gibson, 26, the entrepreneur behind The Whole Pantry recipe and health app, publicly said $300,000 in profits would go to charity, but they never did . There have also been revelations that Ms Gibson was dishonest about her recent medical history and told people she was again riddled with cancer, later claiming she had been 'misdiagnosed' Ms Gibson, who shunned traditional treatments to combat her cancer and instead opted for a wholefood and holistic approach to battling the disease, said she was confused by her misdiagnosis. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong... (I felt) confused, bordering on humiliated', Ms Gibson told The Australian. She revealed a medical team from Germany had examined her using 'magnetic' therapy and believes this investigation led to her misdiagnosis, although she declined to name the medical team. In July 2014 she broke the news of her illness to her followers through an impassioned post to her personal Instagram page. It read in part: 'With frustration and ache in my heart // my beautiful, gamechanging community, it hurts me to find space tonight to let you all know with love and strength that I've been diagnosed with a third and fourth cancer. 'One is secondary and the other is primary. I have cancer in my blood, spleen, brain, uterus, and liver. I am hurting,' Ms Gibson wrote. Around 12 weeks after the initial post she followed up her initial post, revealing she was undergoing 'German integrative oncology protocol'. 'I'm following the same, yet amplified holistic medicine treatment plan, taking what I need from each respected modality; herbalism, acupuncture, nutrition etc and a new addition to it all with a German integrative oncology protocol. It took me a while, but I'm back in (adjusted) full force and taking each day as it comes.' On Monday Fairfax Media revealed Ms Gibson had not delivered on her promise to donate 25 per cent of The Whole Pantry's profits to charity, and reported she had lied about donating $300,000 in funds to a number of organisations. The Whole Pantry brand, which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms, is run by mother-of-one Ms Gibson, who charges $3.79 for the app . Ms Gibson has almost 200,000 followers on her personal Instagram account, who she has kept updated on her health and progress over the past few years. However there appear to be a number of inconsistencies in her medical history, age, and some recent ailments. The Australian reported that in 2009 she claimed to have undergone multiple heart surgeries where she died on the operating table, and months later was told by a doctor she had terminal brain cancer which left her only four months to live. She has said publicly that she was 20 at the time, but other documentation has indicated that she was born in 1991, meaning she was 17 in 2009. Many of Ms Gibson's social media postings from recent years have been removed, and her Instagram account is now private. Furthermore, when The Whole Pantry took to Facebook on Monday to defend the company, they appeared to be deleting comments questioning the validity of Ms Gibson's illness and business plan. The Whole Pantry brand, which has hundreds of thousands of followers across social media platforms, is run by mother-of-one Ms Gibson, who charges $3.79 for the app. At least five charities who purportedly had money raised for them through a number of campaigns run by Ms Gibson never saw any funds. The app, which has been downloaded over 300,000 times, proved so popular she was flown out to Silicon Valley last year where she was told her app was to be included on the Apple Watch. The 26-year-old has publicly claimed that 25 per cent of the business' profits were being donated to charity, last year claiming that $300,000 had been donated. However Ms Gibson told Fairfax Media this week that those donations had never been made, citing disappointing app sales and miscalculated profit margins. Neither Melbourne's Asylum Seeker Resource Centre or One Girl - who were donated $1000 after questions were raised - received any money from Ms Gibson initially and the former claimed that it wasn't aware money was being raised in its name. 'In late 2013 The Whole Pantry advised One Girl that they would be fundraising on our behalf in an online fundraising event,' Chantelle Baxter, CEO, One Girl told Daily Mail Australia in a statement. 'In early 2015 One Girl approached Belle Gibson from The Whole Pantry to enquire about when a donation would be made to One Girl and how much was raised from the fundraising event.' She has also released a cookbook version of the creations following the success of the app . Ms Baxter said One Girl received a response from The Whole Pantry last week, which coincided with initial media inquiries into the business and they 'have since made a donation of $1,000 to One Girl.' 'Since this donation One Girl has asked The Whole Pantry for confirmation of the total amount raised through the online event and are awaiting their response,' Ms Baxter added. Apparently only $7000 in total has reached charities so far, after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated. Penguin, the publisher of Ms Gibson's book which was launched off the back of her app's success said they did not see it necessary to seek confirmation on the entrepreneur's medical history or age during their dealings with her. 'Penguin did not seek or receive documentary evidence of Belle's medical condition or birth date prior to publication,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'We did not feel this was necessary as The Whole Pantry is a collection of food recipes, which Penguin has published in good faith. 'We are concerned about the questions raised in recent days - we'll discuss them with Belle as ultimately only she can answer the questions,' the spokesperson added. There were also revelations that neither the business nor Ms Gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises, a situation that could lead to huge fines and potential jail time. Daily Mail Australia has contacted The Whole Pantry for comment and while they could not be reached at the time of publishing, they had earlier posted a lengthy response on social media addressing some of claims made in the original article. There have been revelations that The Whole Pantry business nor Ms Gibson were lawfully registered as fundraising enterprises . Ms Gibson has appeared across a number of networks (pictured on Sunrise) speaking about her approach to healing . In the post to their Facebook page the company clarified they were a 'for-profit' company and claimed the discrepancy in funds was due to their inexperience in the industry. 'We have, like all start ups, struggled with managing all facets of a new business, biting off more than we could chew, juggling internal and external priorities with little staff. 'We have since passed our overdue business records and accounts over to an external Business Manager and Accounts team, an issue we are reassured arises often with overwhelmed new businesses. 'They have been working over our finances for the last five months, and are still proceeding with a resolution in close sight. We were advised by this team to follow their process and allow them to finalise the donations once all business keepings were accounted first and brought forward,' the post read in part. 'Our books are taking longer to bring up to date than anticipated. TWP forecasted income in October 2014 which was not fulfilled, creating cash-flow issues and unforeseen delays on finalising three discussed charitable donations,' another section of the post read. By citing 'cash flow issues' as Ms Gibson did when explaining the business model and why charities had received no donations, the lengthy response garnered harsh criticism from commentators. Last year it was revealed the app would feature on the new Apple Watch . Apparently only $7000 of a projected $300,000 has reached charities so far, after campaigns flopped and profit margins were miscalculated . 'Appalling - your organisation not the media. Money for charity doesn't go into 'cash flow' - that is beyond unethical, surely it's illegal?', one angry subscriber posted. 'You have skipped the entire point in your very long and wordy response. YOU took money from people who GAVE you the money believing it would go to said charities, you FAILED to forward on the money,' another poster wrote. '... That my friends is dishonesty / theft in the highest degree and takes advantage of peoples good natures. SHAME on you,' the comment continued. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Belle Gibson, The Whole Pantry, and a number of the charities who were to receive donations, for comment.

    Last summer, for a party at home in Devon, we thought it would be fun to make an earth oven where you dig a hole in the garden, light a fire and cook meat — in this case, lamb — in the ground. But by 7pm, it was clear the meat wasn’t cooking quickly enough. Already, the children were starting to go rogue. I had lots of mouths to feed, but nothing to put on plates. If my guests weren’t going to go home hungry, I’d have to do something quickly. I rushed to my larder and breathed a sigh of relief. There on the shelves were enough ingredients to feed the five thousand. Indeed, my sister Sofie always jokes that we could survive a nuclear winter with the contents of my larder. Kirstie Allsopp (pictured) says her well-stocked larder is the pride of her home, and even had a bespoke larder specially made after discovering her second home didn't come with one already built-in . I’m not saying it was something Jamie Oliver would have been proud to put his name to, but from a range of foods that included tomatoes, flour, milk, cheese, pine nuts and chilli oil, I made three types of sauces and served them with pasta. No one went hungry. My larder had saved the day. According to research, the larder has come back in from the cold. John Lewis say that half of their customers shopping for new kitchens want to integrate a larder into their design. Last week, David Cameron was photographed preparing a meal in his kitchen at Downing Street. Next to his super-huge fridge was a modest but perfectly formed larder, stocked with everything from Marmite to mango chutney. Some say the resurgence is thanks to Downton Abbey, with inspirational scenes of Mrs Patmore and assistant cook Daisy in their larder. Indeed, the very word ‘larder’ makes you think of the cavernous cold rooms found in stately homes such as Highclere Castle (where Downton is filmed), which traditionally were bursting with salted meat, pickles, preserves and fresh bread. But you’ve never had to be a lord to own a larder. In the Fifties, even the most modest new-build would have had a walk-in space at the back of the kitchen where food was stored. There was wall-to-floor shelving and often a marble shelf to keep food such as butter and cheese as chilled as possible. Kitchen suppliers and property agents have reported that more buyers are now looking for built-in larders like Kirstie's (pictured). 'A good larder can even add value to a property,' says the TV presenter . It was the arrival of the fridge in the mid-Fifties that dampened our ardour for the larder. Though the first ones cost the equivalent of £4,500 in today’s money, as prices came down and more people were able to afford one, larders went out of fashion. And that’s a shame. In the U.S., where summers are baking hot, I can see why the fridge is a necessity. But in our damp, cold climate, do we really need quite so much of our food kept at temperatures close to freezing? The simple answer is ‘No’. Unless we’re in the middle of a heatwave, most food can be kept for several days in the dark, cool climate of a larder. Eggs, for instance, should keep beautifully fresh for several weeks in a cool larder. Tomatoes taste infinitely better straight from the larder, as do avocados, bananas, apples and oranges. Some say the resurgence is thanks to Downton Abbey, with inspirational scenes of Mrs Patmore (right) and assistant cook Daisy (left) in their larder . I don’t keep any of my jams, pickles or sauces in the fridge: I don’t want chilled jam on my toast. I don’t even keep my cheese in the fridge, particularly runny French varieties. Health and safety would say I’m endangering the health of my family — but I haven’t poisoned anyone yet. To be honest, my larder is one of my favourite things in our home. There was already a larder in our house in Devon, so when we moved into our second house in West London nine years ago, I had one built into the kitchen. It’s 5ft by 6ft, with four deep shelves around three of the walls. It has a wine rack and spice rack, as well as a free-standing rack for veg. True to tradition, there’s a marble shelf and a small window, which we keep open. Kirstie (pictured) loves her larder so much, she chooses to use it more frequently than her fridge. 'Not only does food taste better, there’s also far less waste,' says the Location, Location star . My partner Ben hated it and wanted me to knock it down as soon as he saw it. I stood my ground, and he now admits it’s one of the great triumphs in the house. To start with, I confess, my use of the shelves was pretty chaotic. But a few years ago, while we were on holiday, our super-organised nanny Heather rearranged all the shelves. She bought dozens of containers and jars from Lakeland and transformed that little room. Now, I’m a slave to its military precision. Sometimes, I’ll go in and just stand there, admiring the neatly lined-up packets and jars. I took a picture of it at its tidiest and attached it to the door, with a note: ‘PLEASE KEEP THE LARDER THIS WAY!’ As we only have two cupboards in our entire kitchen, it’s not just food that we keep in the larder. Our medicines, alcohol, mixers, Tupperware, picnic stuff and Thermos flasks are stored there, too. Kirstie reveals that she now only has two storage cupboards in her kitchen (pictured), instead storing everything from spices and sauces to alcohol, medicines, Tupperwear and picnic sets in her beloved larder . The only things we don’t keep in it are chemicals for cleaning and washing. We do own a fridge. In fact, we recently got our first new fridge. (Ben is a property developer, so we’ve always had hand-me-down fridges.) But while most people’s fridges are bursting at the seams, if you open the door to ours, it looks as if we haven’t shopped for a month. So, why do I love my larder so much? Well, not only does food taste better, there’s also far less waste. We’re a shockingly profligate nation, throwing a third of the fresh food we buy. I wonder how much of this is due to our groceries getting ‘lost’ at the back of a crammed fridge? It’s so much more convenient to walk into a single small area and see exactly what items you have at a glance. 'Unless we’re in the middle of a heatwave, most food can be kept for several days in the dark, cool climate of a larder,' says Kirstie (pictured in her kitchen) My TV colleague Phil Spencer says he’s noticed an increase in buyers asking for a larder when searching for property. That doesn’t surprise me. There’s something about a larder that appeals to our emotions to do with providing for our family. Though I’m not a hoarder when it comes to things like clothes, there’s something reassuring about seeing enough pasta, rice and even medicines on the shelves to know that if the shops all shut tomorrow, and civilisation collapsed, I could feed my family for a while longer. A larder is more ecological, too. These awful American monolith fridges use an extortionate amount of energy, while even the average fridge uses two units of electric power per hour — enough to run a small TV for 20 hours. But a larder, well, apart from a light switch, it’s energy free. What’s more, it adds value to the house — though it’s hard to say precisely how much. But this isn’t about money. I’ve always said that a house only works if the kitchen works — and for me, the larder is the secret of a truly successful kitchen. I wouldn’t be without mine. Love It Or List It, presented by Kirstie Allsopp & Phil Spencer, starts on Channel 4 in April.

    Three dogs were killed after a swarm of bees attacked and stung them to death in the backyard of a Santa Ana home where they lived. The animals' owner, Linnea Chapman, found her Australian Shepherds, Bartlett, Bailey, and Remy dead in the backyard and covered in bees on Tuesday night. The swarm of Africanized honey bees had made a large hive inside of an old cabinet in their neighbors' backyard, and the bees had become angry from the dogs barking and attacked, according to Santa Ana Animal Services. Scroll down for video . Australian Shepherds Bartlett, Bailey and Remy (pictured above) were found dead by their owner Linnea Chapman in the backyard of the Santa Ana home . The swarm of Africanized honey bees stung the bees and had made a hive inside of an old cabinet (pictured above) located in the backyard of a neighbor's home . On Tuesday night, Linnea (pictured above) came home from grocery shopping when she found it odd the dogs were not barking as usual . 'It's surreal. It is heartbreaking. It's devastating,' said Linnea. Animal Services said this was the first time there had been a fatal attack like this in Santa Ana, according to KTLA. On Tuesday night, Linnea had come home from grocery shopping when she suspected something was wrong when she did not hear the dogs barking. She went into her backyard with a flashlight which is when she first found the oldest dog, Bartlett, and was shocked. The city's animal control officers were able to trace the swarm of bees to the hive inside the cabinet of the next door neighbors . She said: 'I went out and stumbled across the first one. I couldn't believe it. I said, 'Wake up. Wake up' and then I saw the second and then the third.' Linnea and her husband, who do not have children, grieved the loss of their beloved pets who were like family, and who they had owned since they were puppies, according to NBC Los Angeles. The dogs had been barking at the pool cleaner which agitated the bees. They eventually attacked and stung the animals, said Sondra Berg from Santa Ana Animal Services. Sondra Berg (above) from Santa Ana Animal Services said the bees became agitated after the dogs were barking at the pool cleaner . Bee Busters, a private bee specialist, has since removed the hive (pictured above dead bees from the hive) She also said there were thousands of bees found in the backyard. The city's animal control officers were able to trace the swarm of bees to the hive in the backyard of the Chapmans' elderly neighbors, which was near to where the dogs' bodies were found, according to police. Bee Busters, a private bee specialist, has since been called to the neighbors' home to remove the hive. Linnea plans to have necropsies performed on the dogs so she can learn exactly how they passed away.

    (CNN)Icelandic photographer Sigga Ella wanted to show that people with Down syndrome are more than a chromosomal abnormality. They are diverse and they're unique, just like everyone else in the world. Ella's series, "First and foremost I am," consists of 21 portraits of people ranging from 9 months to 60 years old. She chose the number 21 to represent chromosome 21, the location of the most common genetic mutation causing the condition. It is currently on exhibit at the Reykjavík Museum of Photography and will be featured in May at the Warsaw Festival of Art Photography. Ella shot the photos in 2013 and 2014 as part of a final project at The School of Photography in Reykjavik. She recently shared the images with CNN iReport. The inspiration started with a radio interview Ella heard in which people were discussing ethical questions brought up by prenatal tests to detect birth defects. She hopes her photos shine a light on "the beauty and diversity of mankind" and make us wonder if a future without that diversity is desirable. "I am not against prenatal/genetic testing for abnormalities but I think we need to stop and think what's next. ... It's necessary to open the discussion and educate people more about Down syndrome. It's not a disease or a flaw. Parents of children with Down syndrome ... wouldn't exchange them for anything in the world." The title of the series, "First and foremost I am," comes from a newspaper article by Halldora Jonsdottir, a 30-year-old woman who is also featured in Ella's project. "I have Down syndrome but FIRST AND FOREMOST I AM Halldora," Jonsdottir writes. "I do a million things that other people do. My life is meaningful and good because I choose to be positive and see the good things in life. I go to work, attend school and have hobbies." Jonsdottir goes on to say, "Who is perfect? Who can say, that we who have Down syndrome are worth less that anyone else? We are all different and would it be so great if we were all alike?" Ella staged the portraits against a floral background because she wanted the subjects "to stand out but also underline that all kinds of flowers can grow and flourish together." The photo shoots lasted from one to three hours. She said she didn't give any coaching or direction for how they should pose; she just talked with them and waited for the right moment to shoot. "My favorite part of this project was how relaxed the atmosphere was. No one was pretending to be anything, the emotions were real and some of the times, there was such genuine happiness."

    Rugby union has a well-worn reputation for being the game of the elite and now we have the indisputable proof, that you indeed need to spend flash dollars to watch the rah-rahs best in action. In a Daily Mail Australia investigation into the cost of taking a family to the football, the Queensland Reds' Super Rugby games at Suncorp Stadium came in a long last, costing about $90 more than the best value - the Western Sydney Wanderers at Pirtek Stadium. With family budgets on a tighter rein than ever before, the challenge is where to best spend your sporting dollar. And judging by the secrets kept by some stadia and their teams, you get the distinct impression they don't really want you to know. So we decided to put them to the test and try and settle the argument, once and for all, by piecing together a direct comparison of a day (or night) out, for a family of four, to the home ground of the top two supported teams in each code. Winners are grinners. Asian champions Western Sydney Wanderers have played before packed houses at Pirtek Stadium for the past two years but while they are testing their fans' resolve this season in the A League they can still boast that they are looking after their loyal followers when it comes to pricing . The Rabbitohs, with almost 32,000 members to their name, kick off their title defence in the NRL on Thursday against rugby league's other best supported club, the Brisbane Broncos but both fall just short in the pricing against AFL's best supported club Collingwood . The Magpies playing at both the MCG and Etihad provide good value for a family of fans, particularly after the home of AFL announced it would cut the cost of food and beverages. Collingwood can boast the biggest following of any Australian football club with almost 70,000 members . The Queensland Reds have one of the largest membership bases with 28,000 now signed up. While Suncorp Stadium is considered among the best to watch football in Australia following the Super Rugby does not come cheap, ranking last in the Daily Mail's assessment in value for money . Rugby League launches into action tonight with the premiers South Sydney tackling the Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium, considered by many the premier sporting venue in Queensland. But does it stack up against Victoria's home of AFL, the MCG? Or what about the tight-knit groups at Pirtek Stadium which back Asian Champions League winners, Western Sydney Wanderers or AAMI Park's A League toppers, Melbourne Victory. It was on the following criteria; a family ticket in general admission (2 adults and 2 children), with the purchase of two meat pies, two hot dogs and two buckets of chips plus one beer, one soft drink and two bottles of water, as well as two supporter caps. Clubs, governing bodies, trusts and stadiums were invited to provide the relevant information. And the winner is: Western Sydney Wanderers at Pirtek Stadium in Parramatta. The Asian Champions League title-holders provide their 17,000 (capped) devoted followers with great value at $147.80. Such was the push for membership that officials had to restrict the number in line with the capacity at Pirtek and the club placed more than a thousand hopefuls on a waiting list. 1. Western Sydney Wanderers at Pirtek Stadium Parramatta $147.80 . 2. Collingwood Magpies at Melbourne Cricket Ground $155.10 . 3. South Sydney Rabbitohs at ANZ Stadium Homebush Bay $163.50 . 4. Adelaide Crows at Adelaide Oval $178.78 . 5. Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium $202.80 . 6. Queensland Reds at Suncorp Stadium $236.04 . *Based on prices from clubs, stadiums and governing bodies . Sometimes it's the little things, as Pirtek catering officials were quick to point out, that their meat pies and chips all come with sauce included in the price. The MCG was fast out of the blocks, this week, ahead of the AFL bounce, touting a drop in prices for a pie at the footy, a move which was widely acclaimed by supporters. A game at 'the G', watching Collingwood do battle against Essendon on Anzac Day, for instance, will set you back just $155.10 for a family outing. Souths at ANZ Stadium and the Crows at Adelaide Oval come in 3rd and 4th. Suncorp Stadium is arguably the best venue in Australia to watch the footy but unfortunately what is beyond reasonable doubt, is that you pay for the privilege, as can be seen by the price of a Broncos game $202.80. The Reds confirm it by taking out the value wooden spoon, by far the most expensive at $236.04. There's no argument that the matter of pricing in the competitive Australian market has become an increasingly thorny issue. While some happily revealed the costs, others were not so forthcoming. Of those who were requested the information, the South Sydney Rabbitohs and Queensland Reds were fastest to act, providing all the details requested within in a relatively short period of time. So too, the Wanderers and Broncos. But others were not so forthcoming, preferring to completely sidestep the issue, including the NSW Waratahs. The Super Rugby champions simply referred DMA to their website and Ticketek for details of pricing. Their home ground of Allianz Stadium, run by the SCG Trust, refused to reveal what they charge for a meat pie and beer. Perhaps worse, the Adelaide Crows did not reply to repeated requests for the figures, even over a 48-hour period. However, in stark contrast, Adelaide Oval officials, provided a quick and detailed summary and also highlighted the added extras of an event at the revamped home of South Australian sport, including the ability for supporters to take their own 'packed lunch and thermos'. More reason to cheer their team. Western Sydney Wanderers fans get the best deal when it comes to supporting a football club in Australia. They topped the ranks in Daily Mail's value for money investigation . The heat is on. While Suncorp and the Reds offered up all details, Allianz Stadium, which is home to Super Rugby champions the NSW Waratahs, chose not to reveal any details of how much it costs for food and drink at a big game . A WSW home game at Pirtek ranks among the most enjoyable for football fans in Australia, its atmosphere rivalled now by its value for money for loyal supporters . And Adelaide Oval is also one of few where boutique beers are available to punters in the general admission areas. On the same day the NRL season was to kick off and with ANZ Stadium playing host to both last year's grand finalists - the Rabbitohs and Bulldogs, officials there said there was no information on pricing which could be provided, only a week out from hosting their first league game of 2015. Melbourne Victory was also unable to provide a breakdown. The pressure has been turned up on all codes as a result of the new deal struck by the Melbourne Cricket Club with its catering contractor. They've reduced the price of a range of products on sale at the stadium in a bid to make going to the football and cricket more family-friendly. In all, eight items have been reduced with bottled water undergoing the biggest price drop from $5 to $3 - that's a discount of about 40 per cent. Suncorp also plays host to the Brisbane Broncos in the NRL. The cost of a family going to watch Queensland's most successful rugby league club is about $202 . MCC chief executive Stephen Gough estimated the price restructure will cost the MCC about $14 million in lost revenue over the course of the seven-year contract. 'We've listened to the fans,' Gough said. 'We understand their affordability concerns and we are very confident that this initiative will be extremely well received.' AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan called on venues around the country to follow the MCG's lead. 'They've made a big statement,' McLachlan said. 'They're leading the agenda now on this issue. Hopefully it's a great outcome for all of our fans across Australia because I think they've put a position out there that people are going to have to respond to.' Etihad Stadium is still negotiating with the AFL on prices but venue management hopes to make an announcement on food pricing before the start of the season. The Adelaide Crows huddle before a match at the Adelaide Oval - where entry conditions are quite relaxed including being able to bring a thermos and packed lunch to the big game .
Summary target: 
    Western Sydney Wanderers are Asian champions and also best on ground when it comes to fans' value for money .
Super Rugby is the most expensive with a day out to watch Queensland Reds at Suncorp getting the wooden spoon for costs .
A decision by the MCG to cut the price of food and drinks means a Collingwood game at the home of AFL is good value for a family .
The price pressures are telling with some clubs and stadiums refusing to reveal the costs of catering .
The most relaxed venue is Adelaide Oval where they let you take in a packed lunch and even a thermos .
Most of the major venues stock only mid-strength standard beers for those in general admission .
Summarized text: 
    The Daily Mail Australia investigation into the cost of watching Super Rugby in Australia. Queensland Reds and Western Sydney Wanderers are among those who have played at Pirtek Stadium. Collingwood, Brisbane Broncos and South Sydney will both be playing in the NRL on Thursday night - but it'll cost you more than the Gold Coast Rabbitohs a family of four if they go to Suncorp or Pirtike Stadium?

    After-effects: Jay Francis shows off his face after he was stung nearly 400 times by an angry swarm on Friday while watching a baseball game with his family . An 89-year-old Utah grandfather who survived being stung by nearly 400 bees while he watched a baseball game with his family on Friday has described the terrifying attack. 'First it was one, then two, then three. Then they were everywhere,' said Jay Francis of the attack. 'It was just horrible. My head started aching. I can't believe how sensitive it was.' 'My whole head was just swollen. I felt like I was a lucky man after hearing the statements the doctors had to make,' he said. The swarm of nearly 1,000 angry bees descended on the baseball game at Elks Field, sending players running and Francis and his family trying to duck for cover. Francis' son, Kevin told KSL he was shocked to turn and see his father enveloped by the bees which had been disturbed from their underground hive. 'His face was just covered in bees. You saw his eyes and his mouth,' Kevin Francis said. The Francis family tried to get the bees off of Jay for 15 minutes before the St. George Fire Department arrived to help. 'Since they were being so aggressive, we used water and foam to destroy those aggressive bees,' said Robert Hooper an official with the St. George Fire Department. 'There were people running everywhere, swatting at bees. It was very chaotic.' Once the swarm was fought off, Francis was rushed to hospital where he was treated for nearly 400 hundred bee stings.

Spray away: Fire crews in St. George, Utah, blast a swarm of bees that attacked a baseball on Friday with foam and water to kill them. Several were injured . His wife was treated for almost a dozen stings herself and his son was hit with 50 stings. The bee attack during the baseball game began when a beehive near a telephone pole at the baseball field was disturbed just after 11 a.m. Lone Peak High School baseball coach Matt Bezzant told The Spectrum newspaper of St. George that the bees came from a dugout and players were chased by as many as 70 bees at one point. Fire crews doused the dugout area with a chemical foam to combat the bees. Swarmed: Baseball fans watching a tournament at Elk's Field in St. George on Friday got the scare of their lives when hundreds of bees began attacking them while they were sitting on the bleachers . Attack: One man was seriously injured and several other people received minor injuries when over 1,000 bees swarmed Elks Field in St. George, Utah, about 11am Friday after their underground hive was disturbed . Casey Lofthouse, a local beekeeper and a member of the Washington County Search and Rescue team, told the St. George News that 'bees will protect their home'. 'Both Africanized or European honeybees will protect their hives. The main difference is that the Africanized bees are more aggressive,' he added. Lofthouse said in the event of a swarm of bees, cover your head and neck as best as possible and vacate the area, preferably going indoors.

    John Barnes claims he is struggling to get a job in management because he is black. The former Liverpool star's last managerial job was at Tranmere in 2009. He lasted four months before being sacked. The 51-year-old has previously been in charge of Celtic and the Jamaica national team. Barnes insisted that had he been white he would have got another job. John Barnes has claimed that the colour of his skin is holding him back from another management job . The former England star made an ill-fated introduction to management with Celtic in 1999 . 'A white manager loses his job and gets another job, he loses his job, he gets another job. Very few black managers can lose their job and get another job,' he told John Barnes: Sports Life Stories, to be broadcast on ITV4 on Tuesday. 'What I can judge it from is by looking at society. How many black people are there in the higher echelons of any industry? We can talk about journalism, we can talk about politics. So why should football be any different?' Barnes' first job in management, at Celtic for the 1999-2000 season, ended in the wake of an embarrassing Scottish Cup defeat to Inverness. But he denied that job was too much too soon. Barnes was sacked as Tranmere manager after a run of two wins from 11 league games . Barnes starred for Liverpool during a 10-year spell at Anfield in his playing career . Barnes found some success as manager of the Jamaica national team in 2008-09 . He said: 'Well, if it comes now at 51, I don't think it will be any different. It's more to do with the perception of my ability to do the job, because there's a certain perception of who can make a good manager.' Barnes' former England team-mate Ian Wright agreed that the colour of his skin was counting against Barnes. The former Arsenal man said: 'With someone of John Barnes' ability and stature, to not have worked more in the game with something that he's desperate to do. I don't know what else it can be?' Former England team-mate Ian Wright agrees that skin colour is limiting Barnes' opportunities . Barnes also talked about the guilt he felt after the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. Barnes, who attended the funerals and met the families of victims following the tragedy, said: 'I felt this guilt that they were coming to watch me. 'I know that they were coming to watch everybody else, and it's Liverpool Football Club. It's an irrational thought. 'So I felt this guilt. And I wasn't sure how they would react because had that been my loved one, I wouldn't want to go and meet footballers or the football team, or ever watch football again.'
Summary target: 
    John Barnes claims he is being held back from a management job by the colour of his skin .
Former Liverpool winger has taken charge of Celtic, Jamaica and Tranmere Rovers in the past .
Ex-England team-mate Ian Wright agrees that colour has played a part .

    Tory efforts to rein in spending and curb welfare payments have won a resounding vote of public approval, according to nation- wide research. There has been no public backlash against five years of austerity and even Labour voters support reforms to the benefits system, the British Social Attitudes Survey found. The report also said that voters have broadly accepted student tuition fees, while the majority of the population is satisfied with the NHS. David Cameron's efforts to rein in spending and curb welfare payments have won a resounding vote of public approval, according to nation-wide research . This support for what are effectively Coalition policies is not reflected in the polls, however, even though the General Election is in six weeks’ time. Over the past few months, Labour has mostly had a lead of between one and three points, on 31 to 33, with the Conservatives on 30. A Daily Mail/ComRes poll this week had both parties on 35 points. In a major vote of confidence for the Government, almost three in four people backed the benefits cap – one of David Cameron’s reforms which has been most severely criticised by the Left. Among Labour supporters two in three back the cap, which restricts handouts to the level of an average wage – currently £500 a week for a family. Despite the support for the Tory policies, Ed Miliband's Labour is still ahead in the polls . Half of voters are unsympathetic to the idea of increasing welfare handouts, with 52 per cent believing unemployment benefits are too high. And a similar percentage think that unemployed people could find a job if they wanted to. The annual report, which is based on 2,878 interviews with people across Britain in autumn last year, also revealed concerns about how welfare claimants spend their money. Six out of ten said that claimants should be able to spend benefits only on specific goods and services, as with food stamps in the US. Fewer than one in ten people think that immigrants – from the EU or elsewhere – should be able to claim welfare payments indefinitely, while even half of Labour voters would set a six-month limit on giving EU arrivals access to the full range of benefits. The findings suggest that voters have not responded to Left-wing outcries against Government cuts. However, there are warnings for the leading parties. More than nine out of ten people think the NHS is facing a funding crisis, and while a majority want to see the health service free to users and paid for out of taxes, fewer than half think it will still be so in ten years’ time. Rachel Ormston of NatCen, which carried out the research, said: ‘The public... has seemingly accepted many of the Coalition’s big reforms. In spite of the narrative of austerity... NHS satisfaction is back up, there is acceptance of tuition fees, and at least some benefits cuts are popular.’ Researchers said they had expected to find a public reaction against spending and benefit cuts. But the report said: ‘The most common position remains that taxes and spending should stay at the same level.’ In 2002 nearly two out of three people said they wanted higher taxes and more spending on health, education and benefits. That fell to just 32 per cent by 2010, and is now up slightly to 37 per cent. The new report added that Labour supporters were more sympathetic to welfare spending than other respondents, but ‘even so they can hardly be regarded as enthusiasts for more, and would prefer that people of working age were in work.’
Summary target: 
    Tory efforts to rein in public spending have won public approval .
Even Labour voters support reforms to benefits system, survey finds .
A majority is also satisfied with he NHS and has accepted tuition fees .
Summarized text: 
    There has been no public backlash against five years of austerity. Labour voters support reforms to the benefits system, survey found in UK and abroad despite Tory policies gaining majority - but Labour is still ahead in polls a large lead compared with Labour 'on 30 points'

    No free speech: Ryan Pate was arrested in Abu Dhabi last month after complaining about his UAE employer on Facebook - a violation of the country's law against slandering an employer . A hallmark of American life - griping about work - has landed a Florida man in a Middle Eastern jail. Ryan Pate, a helicopter mechanic from Belleair Bluffs, Florida, took to Facebook after a dispute over sick leave with the company he was working for in the United Arab Emirates. He was home in Florida at the time, but when he returned to Abu Dhabi last month, he was told to report to the police station, where he was arrested for breaking an Emirates law on slandering his employer. He spent about 10 days in jail, he said, and is now free on bail awaiting a March 17 trial. His supporters say he faces up to five years in prison and a steep fine if convicted. 'I just couldn't register it in my head because as an American growing up in the United States, the First Amendment right is just ingrained in my brain,' he said in a phone interview Wednesday. 'I never even entertained the fact that I would wind up in prison out here for something I put on Facebook in the United States.' Pate, 30, said the incident stemmed from a trip to Florida in December. During his return he spent the holidays with family and proposed to his girlfriend, Jillian Cardoza, but also was trying to get treatment for a back injury. There was disagreement with his bosses about extending his leave to see a doctor, he said, and after a particularly unsatisfactory phone call with them, he took to a Facebook. He says he can't remember precisely what he wrote, but knows he called his bosses 'backstabbers' and warned other contractors not to work for them. He didn't give the rant much thought until he was back in the Persian Gulf, where he planned to handle paperwork to end his employment as well as empty his apartment and sell his car. Soon after, he says he received a call from police telling him to come to the station, where officers showed him screen shots of his comments. Pulled apart: Pate (left) had just proposed to his girlfriend Jillian Cardoza (right) when he was arrested by authorities in the UAE. His trial is set to begin on March 17 . 'I'm being arrested. I'm so sorry. I love you,' Cardoza said he texted her from the station. Pate's congressman, Rep. David Jolly, intervened on his constituent's behalf, lobbying the State Department and Emirates officials for help. In a letter to the Emirati attorney general, Jolly emphasized respect for the sovereignty of the country, but argued because the posts occurred while Pate was on American soil, those laws shouldn't apply. 'It is deeply troubling that Mr. Pate now faces judicial proceedings over an action that was done legally in his home country,' the Republican said. The Emirati Embassy in Washington said it did not have much information about the case and couldn't comment. An after-hours email to the company, Global Aerospace Logistics, did not get an immediate reply. Pate said he's trying not to think too much about the sentence he could face. He says he's remorseful for letting his emotions get the best of him. A GoFundMe page has been set up to support Pate.
Summary target: 
    Ryan Pate was on a break from work, visiting his home in Florida, when he complained on Facebook about spat with UAE employer .
When he flew back to Abu Dhabi to quit, he was arrested for breaking the country's law against slandering an employer .
He faces up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine if convicted .
Pate had just proposed to his girlfriend when he was arrested .
His trial is scheduled for March 17 .

    A rookie Los Angeles police officer is wanted for questioning in a fatal shooting that left a 23-year-old man dead in Pomona. The 2013 Volkswagen Jetta belonging to Officer Henry Solis, 27, of the LAPD, was found a short distance from the site where Salome Rodriguez Jr was gunned down early Friday, but the cop remained at large. Solis was off-duty at the time of the shooting and failed to report to work the next day. Police said they have reason to believe he knows that detectives want to interview him about the shooting. This afternoon, an arrest warrant was issued for the missing officer, who is considered armed and dangerous, according to a statement released by the LAPD. Scroll down for video . Wanted: LAPD Officer Henry Solis (left), 27, is wanted for questioning in the Thursday night fatal shooting of 23-year-old Salome Rodriguez Jr (right) outside a Pomona nightclub . Rookie: Police say Solis joined the force last June and had not completed his probationary period . Cmdr. Andrew Smith, am LAPD spokesman, said Solis was assigned to a station in the San Fernando Valley and had not completed his probationary period since joining the force last June. Rodriguez, 23, of Ontario, died after being shot in the lower torso at around 3.30am. He worked at a Williams-Sonoma warehouse and was out with co-workers at Vive Tequila Lounge and Nightclub Thursday night, relatives told the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin. The LA Times reported that Rodriguez ran bleeding for more than a block before he collapsed to the ground in a parking lot. Rodriguez, the oldest of six children, was also a missionary with St. Vincent Catholic Church in Los Angeles, said his mother, Lidia Angelica Rodriguez. Pomona police have issued a poster calling Solis a 'person of interest' in the shooting that occurred in a downtown bar district after two men got into a fight. Witnesses told police the attacker fled the scene, and they saw a compact car leaving the area. Hotspot: Rodriguez was out with co-workers at Vive Tequila Lounge and Nightclub Thursday night . Final image: This screen grab from a cell phone video shot by a friend of Salome's shows the man dancing in the hours leading up to the shooting . Clue: Solis' 2013 Volkswagen Jetta was found Sunday abandoned in an alley near the scene of the shooting . Man of God: The victim's mother, Lidia Rodriguez (left) said her son (right) was a Catholic missionary . Detectives said they don't believe the men who got into the fight knew each other. Salome's aunt Aracely Monlina suggested that his killing may have resulted from a case of mistaken identity. 'Witnesses said Henry Solis got into an altercation earlier,' Monlina told CBS Los Angeles. 'Then I guess he confused Junior with that person, or something and confronted Junior. Junior said, "It's not me, it's not me."' Monique Ortiz, a friend of Rodriguez's, was with him at the club before the shooting. She shared a video with NBC Los Angeles showing the 23-year-old dancing and laughing in the hours before the deadly confrontation. A man who gave his name as Gene said he was also with Rodriguez at the club until closing time. Afterwards, the two friends, who had been drinking, got into Gene's Audi and settled in for a nap. Gene said when he woke up, he found his vehicle surrounded by police and paramedics. Neither Monique Ortiz nor Gene remembered seeing Henry Solis inside the club. Meanwhile, Rodriguez's loved ones have launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for his funeral. Grieving: Salome Rodriguez's family and friends gathered at the crime scene for an emotional prayer vigil .

    As many as 1,000 greyhounds a year are being exported from Australia to Asia and South America where they are injected with arsenic, cocaine, Viagra and methamphetamines to increase their aggression ahead of fight-to-the-death races. Just weeks after the live-baiting scandal rocked the dog racing industry - when the use of live pigs, possums and rabbits to train greyhounds and boost their aggression was exposed - a horrific and often unsanctioned international trade can also be revealed by Daily Mail Australia. The dogs, both young animals and those at the end of their racing lives, are shipped mostly to Macau, Hong Kong, Argentina and Chile where they are housed in appalling conditions. Scroll down for videos . Australian greyhounds in South America and Asia are fed a cocktail of drugs before being 'run to their death' according to animal welfare groups. This one-time Australian competitor died immediately after a race . Bloodsport. The horrid outcome of a match race in Argentina after two dogs pursue the lure to the end. Animal rights groups in South America say they often descend into a fight to the death . The Canidrome in Macau where many Australian dogs compete. Animals Australia says 'Macau offers no re-homing program for retired greyhounds and ... every dog imported to the country from Australia is dead within around three years' Although there are legal, strictly policed races, at the end of unofficial events the blood-thirsty animals often maul each other to death. If an animal finishes outside the top three in five consecutive races they are euthanised or dumped by the side of the road, where they starve to death. Argentina-based animal rights group Proyecto Galgo says that Australia and American dogs are particularly sought after in South America because of their superior pedigree. Animal protection groups have called for immediate government intervention, fearing that the crackdown on local trainers after the live-baiting scandal was exposed will lead to an increase in the black market trade to these gambling-loving countries. Australian dogs, along with those from the US and Ireland, are considered among the best in the world for both racing and breeding purposes, and are exported to countries which struggle to produce quality runners. In something akin to the barbaric scenes at cock-fighting rings or dog fights, activists say that at some tracks the greyhounds race in pairs down a straight, with frenzied punters packed either side, and the animals often maul each other at the end of a sprint. Animal protection groups in Argentina have joined the call for Australia's Federal Government to intervene, fearing that the crackdown on local trainers because of the live-baiting scandal, will lead to the 'black market' trade of Australian greyhounds gathering even more pace . Killing fields. These stomach churning images are published by animal protection groups as proof of the horrific lack of control over the fate of greyhounds in Asia . Freedom of Information documents obtained by Animals Australia from the Department of Agriculture and seen by Daily Mail Australia show only 20 dogs were officially registered as arriving from Australia in Argentina in the past two years. It's widely suspected that hundreds more have been exported through back channels. There is no information about the fates of these animals. 'Greyhounds here, including those from Australia, suffer a terrible fate,' claims an activist from Proyecto Galgos, who gave her name only as Ines. 'Here the situation is this; they use the galgos (greyhounds) in an exhaustive way. In one day, they can race in many places sometimes (and) are drugged with arsenic, cocaine, Viagra and methamphetamines. 'Sometimes they give them the drugs directly in their chest in the racing facilities. 'Many times they die in the racing facility. A racing galgo doesn't run more than one or two championships because of the drugs.' Some, she said, are saved for breeding but even then they are plied with reproductive drugs. 'That is the best scenario, but if they are no good at running, they are discharged on roads or left to die of starvation and in some cases they are killed.' 'Many times they die in the racing facility. A racing galgo doesn't run more than one or two championships because of the drugs' say animal rights groups in Argentina, who provided this image to show the level of neglect for a one-time racing dog . If they are no good at running, they are discharged on roads, or left to die of starvation, and in some cases they are killed' according to Proyecto Galgos from Argentina . With punting, legal and otherwise, a major past-time in parts of Argentina and Chile, exposing those who trade in the barbarism comes at a cost for groups like Proyecto Galgos, with members subjected to death threats on a regular basis. 'Here (in South America) they are used as merchandise, they are objects and when they aren't useful anymore they get rid of them,' Ines said. 'Sometimes they are sold and other times they change them for a chair or a television or anything.' Races are prohibited in two Argentinian regions, including the capital Buenos Aires and in Santa Fe. Cordoba is debating whether to shut down the industry too. While it is clear that many have previously been sent using official channels, through the control of authorities via a 'greyhound passport', there has been a crackdown on that process by governing bodies like Greyhounds Australasia. The exports, however, continue unabated. Lobbyists say just how so many end up in countries like Argentina and Korea (which is not on the official list) remains a mystery. Greyhounds Australasia CEO Scott Parker admitted that GA has no control of the greyhound export industry. ‘We have absolutely no idea of what dogs had gone where in the past six months because we are totally out of the loop,' he said. ‘It’s because of the lack of regulations, something we have stressed to the (Agriculture) Minister and hoped we’d get a meeting with him to discuss it but that hasn't eventuated as yet but we are still trying. Greyhound data shows some of Australia's best known runners have been sent through the correct channels over the years to spend their time in the breeding kennels in places like South America. Animal activists want tighter controls on exports by the Federal Government to ensure the future of all greyhounds . Lobbyists say not all dogs face the same fate, however, pointing to several examples over the years of top Australian greyhounds like this one being cared for in the correct manner by respected Argentinian studs . ‘The passport has no government regulatory standing but at least that enabled us to make sure they (greyhound owners) were doing the right thing . ‘Exporting Australian greyhounds without a GA issued passport is against the rules but some might take the risk knowing that government allows their export as long as the dogs are fit and well. ‘They enter into private arrangements and when someone says 100 have gone over in the past month, it’s out of our hands – a member of the public with no connection to the governing body can send them to anywhere in the world, if they want.’ He's also called on the Federal Government to put strong legislation behind 'the rules' of greyhound exports. There are examples of successful transitions; including star performers Bogie Ace and The Chief, who had top careers on the track in Australia and went on to have rewarding stud lives and were treated humanely. They, however, are rare examples. Up until now, authorities have been scrambling to keep on top of the shipping of Australian greyhounds to Asia, particularly Macau, for competition at the Yat Yuen Canidrome, but now revelations they are appearing with greater frequency in South America, has activists concerned. 'I think what’s clear is that the welfare of greyhounds is not a priority, these dogs come a distant second to profits on offer in this industry,' Lisa Chalk from Animals Australia said. 'In Australia, thousands of healthy dogs are killed simply because they don’t run fast enough and hundreds are exported overseas each year to countries that have no laws to protect them from cruelty. 'The country of greatest concern currently is Macau where dogs are raced at a facility called the Canidrome. 'They are kept in small cages when not racing and are killed if they fail to finish in the top three for five consecutive races. 'Dogs sent to Macau from Australia are dead within three years. Greyhound racing in Macau is built around the supply of dogs from Australia which makes the situation all the more outrageous.' Advocates also warn that, many of the export countries (in Asia), are known for their huge illegal trade in dog meat for human consumption. 'Macau offers no re-homing program for retired greyhounds and the head of the Macau government’s animal control department has stated that every dog imported to the country from Australia is dead within around three years,' Ms Chalk added. 'Greyhounds Australasia has stopped issuing passports to allow greyhounds to be sent for racing but that hasn't stopped the export. 'It's time for the Australian Government to take a stand and ban the export of greyhounds altogether.' Animal advocates have called on the Australian Government 'to take a stand and ban the export of greyhounds altogether' to provide more protection for the animals. This is an example of a neglected pup in Argentina . The live-baiting scandal has led to more than 70 Australian trainers being implicated. Five Queensland greyhound trainers have already been banned for life . Animals Australia claim that 'greyhounds from Australia were killed at the Canidrome at a rate of more than one every day'. 'Nearly all of these dogs were healthy and not even five years old. All they had done wrong is fail to finish in the top three for five consecutive races,' Ms Chalk said. 'With an ongoing supply of dogs from Australia, this unethical practice can continue, and is even threatening to expand.' Macau is the only place in China where greyhound racing is currently legal but that could soon be expanded. Her South American colleagues agree: 'The shortage of quality animals (in South America) means the exporting to places such as Argentina from Australia can be a profitable business.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Minister for Agriculture's office for comment. With punting, legal and otherwise, a major past-time in parts of Argentina and Chile, exposing those who trade in the barbarism comes at a cost for groups like Proyecto Galgos, who are subjected to death threats on a regular basis .

    The Married at First Sight star who looked like she was about to become a runaway bride on the reality show's season two premiere has revealed that she did indeed marry the groom she initially refused to say ‘I do’ after deciding he wasn’t attractive enough. Jaclyn Methuen, from Union, New Jersey, spoke with Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb on Friday morning’s episode of the Today show about her look of displeasure when she first walked down the aisle – and confessed why she was really hesitant to say 'I do' to her now-husband Ryan Ranellone. 'I put so much pressure on my intuition,' the 30-year-old sales rep explained. 'I thought I was going to know that this guy is my soulmate and we were going to have that connection and those sparks.' Scroll down for video . All smiles: Jaclyn Methuen revealed on Friday's Today show that she did end up marrying Ryan Ranellone on season two of Married at First Sight - even though she said she was unimpressed by his physical appearance . Full of delusion: The 30-year-old told Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb that her look of displeasure when she saw her now-husband for the first time was the result of thinking it would be love at first sight . On the last Tuesday's two-hour episode of the FYI-channel reality show, 29-year-old Ryan happily agreed to marry Jaclyn, but the episode ended in a cliffhanger when she admitted she had doubts about her arranged marriage. 'I first see Ryan, my gut just says: "Oh man, like this is him?"' she told the cameras. 'The initial physical attraction really isn't there right now.’ She continued: 'When I saw him face-to-face, I felt a little disappointed. It just doesn't feel like this is the man who is my husband. I don't know if I can do this.' But Ryan, a Long Island real estate agent, did not have to think twice when it came to his betrothed's appearance, and Jaclyn's Today show interview confirmed that she would eventually say 'I do'. Unhappy camper: The sales rep, who had been single for seven years, said she thought there were going to be sparks when she saw Ryan at the altar for the first time . Not my fault! Jaclyn, who can be seen with Ryan on their wedding day, blamed her thinking on being single for so long and watching 'too many rom-coms' Full house: Jaclyn had appeared on the Today show with fellow Married at First Sight participants Davina Kullar and Jessica Castro, as well as Dr Joseph Cilona, who helped arrange the pairings . After watching the clip from the episode, Hoda said that Ryan looked like he had won the jackpot when he saw Jaclyn walk through the door but noted that her initial reaction was filled with a lot of expletives that had to be bleeped out during the episode. Both she and Kathie Lee were stunned that Jaclyn thought that it would be love at first sight. 'Why would you think that?' they both asked her. Jaclyn, who hadn't been serious with any man in the past seven years, said: 'Because I was single for so long. I watched too many rom-coms.’ Being honest: During her appearance on the morning show, Davina, 34, said she respected her mother's decision to skip her reality TV show wedding . Hard work: Dr Cilona explained the scientific process behind the matchmaking on Married at First Sight, revealing that he had given each contestant five psychological personality tests . And while she knew it sounded silly, Jaclyn said she really thought her soul was going to recognize its counterpart in him. '[I thought] we were just going to light it up and it was going to be perfect,' she said of her pre-conceived notions of their first meeting. 'The reality was that he was a stranger, and I didn't know anything about him.' Jaclyn had appeared on the Today show with fellow Married at First Sight participants Davina Kullar, 34, and Jessica Castro, 30, as well as the show's licensed clinical psychologist Dr Joseph Cilona, who helped arrange the pairings. Unlike Jaclyn, Davina was pleased with her groom Sean Varricchio's physical appearance, but her reality show nuptials were missing her mother, who disapproved of her doing the show. Big step: Jessica, 30, spoke about being able to trust her new husband after her former fiance cheated on her . High hopes: Jessica, who can be seen with her husband Ryan DeNiro on their wedding day, told Kathie Lee and Hoda and she won't let her past define her . 'In my family, I have always been the risk taker...' the 34-year-old sales rep explained. 'I took the risk. Another piece of this is that my family is from the West Coast and I wasn't able to sit down and look them in the eye and tell them [about the wedding].' Davina maintained that she respected her family's decision and noted that she was still speaking to her mom throughout the process. 'She was still there in the way that she could be,' she said of her mother. I don’t? Jaclyn couldn’t bring herself to say 'I do' to Ryan, whom she met for the first time at the altar on Tuesday's season two premiere of Married at First Sight . Seconds thoughts: Jaclyn began to have doubts about marrying a perfect stranger after seeing him for the first time. Meanwhile, Ryan said he was a 'happy camper' when he saw his bride walk down the aisle . Awkward: The bride-to-be couldn’t look Ryan in the eye during their wedding. She noted that she was 'disappointed' by his physical appearance . Tick tock: After Ryan said 'I do', he was left awkwardly waiting while Jaclyn had second thoughts . As to whether or not her mom has come around to her new husband, Davina said viewers will have to 'stay tuned'. Kathie Lee and Hoda were also curious to see if Jessica, 30, was afraid of trusting a stranger after her former fiance cheated on her. 'I wasn't going to let my past define me,' she told them. 'I wasn't going to just assume that I couldn't trust this person. The receptionist said she is optimistic about her future with 29-year-old Ryan DeNino because two of the three couples from season one of the show are still happily married. Unlucky in love: Jaclyn, a sales rep for Tito’s Handmade Vodka from Union, New Jersey, had been single for past seven years and hadn't had sex in two years . Confident: Ryan, a Long Island real estate agent, had been single for eight months. After a string of long-distance relationships, he finally felt ready to settle down . Agreeing to marry a complete stranger may seem strange, but Dr Cilona told Kathie Lee and Hoda that during the matchmaking process he administered five psychological personality tests, as well as an in-depth questionnaire that he created. Dr Cilona explained that the amount of compiled research this past season alone resulted in 3,800 pages. In addition to Dr Cilona, three other specialists – sexologist, Dr Logan Levkoff; sociologist, Dr Pepper Schwartz; and spiritual advisor, Greg Epstein – took the three women's needs and created what they believe are three perfect couples, based on scientific matchmaking. Helping hand: Davina, a biopharmaceutical sales rep from Manhattan's Upper East Side, is one of the show's 'singles' Over the course of several weeks, viewers will be able to watch as the couples go from wedding, to honeymoon, to 'early nesting', and then to the daily struggle of marriage. But before they walked down the aisle, the show's participants shared what they were looking for in an ideal match. Jaclyn admitted that she hadn't had sex in two years and confessed that she hoped her new husband would be 'personable, secure and confident', while her new husband Ryan said his perfect wife was loyal, dedicated and family-oriented. He had been single for eight months. After a string of long-distance relationships, he explained that he finally felt ready to settle down. Great expectations: Sean Varricchio, 35, an ER/trauma nurse from Jackson, New Jersey said he was looking for a wife who is 'athletic, intelligent, motivated and professional, with a good heart, and good family values' Davina, who is from Manhattan's Upper East Side, said she wanted to get married at first sight because she has 'dated so many different types of men' that she 'started to doubt whether I was even looking for the right qualities’. Meanwhile, her new husband Sean, 35, an ER/trauma nurse from Jackson, New Jersey was on the lookout for a wife who is 'athletic, intelligent, motivated and professional, with a good heart, and good family values'. 'I have a science background, I'm very analytical and I thought there's got to be something to this,' he said. And Jessica, who also lives in Manhattan, confessed that she is 'finally at a place in her life where she feels she is ready to settle down and get married,' after learning that her former fiance was unfaithful. Moving on: Jessica, a receptionist at a law firm in Manhattan, said she is 'finally at a place in her life where she feels she is ready to settle down and get married,' after her fiance cheated on her . Searching for his soulmate: Ryan DeNino, 29, from Staten Island. Mr DeNino owns his own consulting business said he has been single for one year after he and his girlfriend of five years broke up . She had been single for two years and explained that she wants a husband who is 'close with family (especially his mother), independent, strong work ethic, loving and affectionate'. On this week's season premiere she married Ryan, from Staten Island, who owns his own consulting business. He explained to the cameras that he has been single for one year after he and his girlfriend of five years broke up. Why did he want to get married at first sight? 'Knowing there were experts that would… get to know who I am, hopefully find me a match that would be compatible for me,' he said.

    A pregnant model, who is less a month away from giving birth, has come under fire from her Instagram followers after sharing a series of saucy lingerie-clad selfies flaunting her barely-there baby-bump. Sarah Stage, a 30-year-old underwear model and animal rights activist, has documented her changing figure via her Instagram page throughout her pregnancy earning herself a huge number of fans in the process. However, as her pregnancy has progressed, more and more people have begun criticizing the mother-to-be, claiming that her unusually trim and toned figure could be doing damage to her unborn child. 'I would be so nervous!' one critic wrote. 'The baby is probably really small and I would imagine she will have a hard time making milk.’ Scroll down for video . Mom-to-be: Sarah Stage, a Los Angeles-based lingerie model, has been documenting her changing pregnancy body and many of her 1.1m Instagram followers cannot believe she is eight months pregnant . Another added: 'Feed the baby! She's just cares about her looks, not the growing of the baby. So sad that the baby [will be] so tiny when he comes into the world.' The model’s pictures have garnered thousands more similar comments, many of which criticize her for being 'unhealthy' and unnaturally small for a pregnant woman. But while Sarah has faced her fair share of criticisms, others were more complimentary with their comments. 'Everyone is body shaming her. It’s really sad how quick everyone is to judge her and say that she is starving her baby, before actually educating yourselves on why she may look so small,' one person wrote. Proud: Sarah refuses to hide her eight month pregnant body in maternity clothes and prefers to flaunt it in lingerie . Meanwhile, another fan noted: 'Cuteset bump ever!' Despite her critics, Sarah refuses to hide her eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes and prefers to flaunt it on social media for the world to see. Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent and lives in Los Angeles, shuns baggy dresses and instead dresses her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all. The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and captures herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa, spinach and chicken. Clearly not letting her growing baby bump get in the way of her career, Sarah has continued to model whilst carrying. Multi-talented: Sarah is a lingerie model and animal rights activist and adorns billboards in the states . Sarah's first modelling gig was at the tender age of two and the star, who is signed to Elite Model Management, has since adorned billboards and starred in countless campaigns. According to Malaysian Digest, Sarah indulges in occasional cheeseburgers and maintains her trim frame is down to daily gym visits. Comments from her followers include ones such as: 'she looks like me on a normal day' and 'my belly after a burger'. And despite some of her followers criticizing her unique physique, one medical professional claims that, if she feels healthy and happy, Sarah has no need to worry about her baby. Discussing how different women's bodies react during pregnancy, Dr Venkat, Director at Harley Street Fertility Clinic, said: 'If a woman is healthy - physically and mentally - to start with and if she looks after herself well then she will look radiant. Gym bunny: The model credits her svelte figure to her regular work-out sessions in the gym . 'The hormones are elevated during pregnancy and women react differently to the hormones. 'Some women are particularly sensitive to elevated hormones and suffer with symptoms, whereas others sail through without any symptoms.' Dr Venkat added that a woman's height plays a role and the taller a woman is can help her carry herself with better posture than a shorter woman. When it comes to working out, she says, women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy. Citing walking and gentle stretching as the best exercises during pregnancy, she says women are going to be exhausted in the first couple of weeks after delivery and can start exercising after a fortnight, once a routine is established. Fan club: Comments from her followers include ones such as 'she looks like me on a normal day' and 'I had to look at it for ages to notice she was pregnant' Popular: Sarah has over 1m Instagram followers who regularly comment on her trim baby body . Medical opinion: Dr Venkat says women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy but Sarah is clearly keen to continue with her regular gym sessions .

    She's as well-known for her stunning figure as she is for her chart-topping hits so it's perhaps no surprise that American songstress Taylor Swift is reported to be insuring her legs for a cool £26.5million. Grammy-winning Taylor, 25, attributes a huge slice of her global success to her energetic stage performances and her team have apparently looked into how much it would cost to insure her legs against potential career-threatening accidents. The Pennsylvania-raised star is embarking upon a global tour in May and the move is said to be a precaution against such a physically-demanding schedule. Scroll down for video . Diamonds in those heels: Taylor Swift's super-slim legs have reportedly been insured for a whopping £26.5million ahead of her gruelling world tour which begins in May . Prized assets: Taylor's pins, on display (left) at the Saturday Night Live anniversary special last month, are considered a key part of her high-energy stage performances. Showing them off at a pre-Grammy Gala in LA in February (right) The Blank Space singer is reported to have said she was 'embarrassed' at how much her slender limbs are said to be worth. Celebrity insurers Lloyd's, which has specialised in offering body-part policies since the 1930s, said they were not surprised by the vast sums attributed to Taylor's pins. Underwriter Jonathan Thomas told FEMAIL: 'Taylor Swift’s income-generating capacity is hugely dependent upon her stage presence and thus her exceptional legs are indeed very likely worth millions of dollars of insurance.' She's certainly not the first celebrity to insure herself, however, with a whole host of other stars on record for ensuring their prize assets, which they often consider the key to their success, are protected by policy. Long before Kim Kardashian's derriere arrived on the scene, Jennifer Lopez famously insured her perfectly-round bottom for millions of dollars. Australian singer Kylie Minogue, whose rear grabbed the headlines in gold hotpants in the video for hit single Spinning Around back in 2000 was said to have insured her behind shortly after to the tune of £3million. That booty! J-Lo (left) was the original doyenne of the derriere and is said to have a £17million premium protecting her bottom. Kylie Minogue (right) has a similar policy, worth £3million . Dolly Parton is as well-known for her 40DD chest as she is for her back-catalogue of country music hits and is alleged to have once insured them for £3.8million - or £1.9million each. Bruce Springsteen's relentless live dates contribute hugely to his overall fortune so he needs more than the price of honey and lemon to keep his voice safe - the vocal chords of 'the Boss' are covered for up to £3million. For obvious reasons, sports stars can also have high premiums attached to certain parts of their anatomies. Although it's common practice for football clubs to insure against injury, a career-threatening tackle on a higher-profile star could potentially lose the club millions in sponsorship deals. In 2006, it was revealed that David Beckham had insured his cross-whipping legs against injury for around £100million while playing for Paris Saint-Germain. While in 2013, Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo's club Real Madrid renewed their insurance for his lightning-quick legs at a cost estimated to be around £74million. Legs eleven: When David Beckham was competing at a professional level, his goal-scoring limbs had a whopping £100million price tag on them. The Boss, aka Bruce Springsteen, is so protective of his lucrative voice that he's insured it for £3million . No need for a stuntman: 007 star Daniel Craig insisted on doing many of his own action scenes in the 2008 Bond film Quantam of Solace...at a cost of £5million in insurance . In 2008, Daniel Craig insisted on doing many of his own stunts for Bond film Quantam of Solace. 'He does a lot more than Pierce used to do,' said the film's chief stunt coordinator Gary Powell at the time, '...and he's allowed to because he's capable of doing it. He thinks, "You're paying to see me, and that's me doing it." He wants the audience to know.' It might have given the film's makers a headache though, for such daredevilry came at an eye-watering insurance price, said to be £5million. A head for business: The Only Way is Essex star Joey said last year that he would insure his perfectly coiffured hair for £1million...shortly after launching his D:Reem range of hair products for Tesco . Good golly, Miss Dolly: Country star Ms Parton has protected her surgically-enhanced bosom for £3.8million while trailing in her wake is reality tv star Holly Madison, who has a similar chest-protecting policy for £66,000 . Million-dollar smile, literally. Film actress Julia Roberts was the subject of an insurance policy that saw her pearly whites covered for just shy of £20million . Becoming savvy about protecting career-boosting parts of the body isn't a new phenomenon. As early as the 1930s celebrities became aware of how much certain bits of them can influence their success. Specialist insurers Lloyd’s say the entertainment industry developing in California in the early 20th century quickly appreciated just how much a film could gross if its central star's appearance was just right. Early film stars such as Cyd Charisse’s (legs) and Jimmy Durante (nose) chose the company to provide them with policies. Present-day clients include  burlesque star Holly Madison’s breasts and NFL player Troy Polamalu’s hair.

    The Blank Space singer is said to be 'embarrassed' by hefty insurance sum .
The star's team are protecting her prized assets ahead of world tour .

    The White House blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday for holding up the confirmation of President Barack Obama's nominee for attorney general, saying the 'unconscionable delay' calls into question the Kentucky lawmaker's leadership abilities. The verbal strike on McConnell came after the Republican legislator said over the weekend that he wouldn't allow a vote on New York prosecutor Loretta Lynch's confirmation until the Senate passes a once bipartisan sex trafficking bill that Democrats are now refusing to support over a provision limiting funding for abortions. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the delay on the attorney general post reflected 'inept leadership,' not a flaw in the trafficking bill, and that the move suggested the White House could no longer trust congressional Republicans to act in good faith. The spat is the latest indication that the respective goodwill professed by the White House and GOP leaders after November's elections, when Republicans were swept into control of Congress, has since soured and is now curdling. Scroll down for video . UNCONSCIONABLE: White House spokesman Josh Earnest blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday for holding up the confirmation of President Barack Obama's nominee for attorney general, saying the delay calls into question the Kentucky lawmaker's leadership abilities . The verbal strike on McConnell came after the Republican legislator said over the weekend that he wouldn't allow a vote on New York prosecutor Loretta Lynch's confirmation until the Senate finishes a once bipartisan human trafficking bill that Democrats are now refusing to support over a provision limiting funding for abortions . Battling for control of the federal government with the executive branch, the first few months of the GOP's reign over the legislative branch has been marked by constant bickering with the White House and numerous veto threats. In an attempt to balance what they saw as executive overreach on the part of the president, who in November took unilateral action to save millions of illegal immigrants from deportation against the wishes of Republicans in Congress, the GOP last month attempted to hold captive funding for the Homeland Security department. The majority party ended up with egg on its face, though, when it opted to back down from the fight and appropriate money to the department rather than watching it to go into shut down mode until Democrats backed a measure to defund Obama's immigration directives - a scenario that may have never come about. House Republicans in January also stuck their finger in the eye of the Obama administration when Boehner secretly invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress. Usually, the executive branch coordinates visits with foreign heads of state. More recently, Senate Republicans wrote a letter to Iranian leaders cautioning them that a nuclear pact with the current administration may not last. The missive could undermine the tenuous negotiations the U.S. and its allies are in with the Middle Eastern country. McConnell is now using the Lynch confirmation vote as a bargaining chip in his fight to keep a provision that would place heavy restrictions on use of money for abortion in a victims fund named in the child sex trafficking bill. Democrats had already signed off on the legislation in committee before they realized that the measure was included. They have since backed away from the bill as is and accused Republicans of trying to hoodwink them, despite having had weeks to read the legislation in full before a final vote. 'If they want to have time to turn to the attorney general bill next week, we need to finish up this human trafficking bill,' McConnell said Sunday on CNN. Earnest at one point suggested that McConnell, pictured here last week at a press conferene on Captiol Hill with other Senate Republicans, is 'inept' as a leader . Obama's spokesman lit into McConnell on Monday over the play. 'You've got to hand it to Republicans, that they've taken even a measure as common sense as that and turned it into a partisan controversy,' Obama's spokesman said today. 'The fact that leader McConnell can't build bipartisan support for a child sex-trafficking bill, I think, is an indication that his leadership here in the majority is not off to a very strong start. Earnest at another point suggested that McConnell is 'inept,' The GOP leader, he said, should just take out the offending abortion measure in order to get Democrats back on board. 'I don't really understand,' he said, why the majority leader doesn't look at this situation and say, 'Let's remove the objection so we can get it passed, and get it signed into law.' Although the White House frequently threatens to veto pending bills unpalatable to Obama, Earnest wouldn't say whether Obama would sign the bill with the abortion language included. He suggested the issue is moot because Republicans don't have enough support to pass it anyway. In a sharp rebuke, the White House appeared to question whether Obama can trust McConnell and his fellow GOP leaders and 'whether their word is good with the president.' Earnest pointed out that McConnell had argued last year that Lynch's confirmation should wait until the new GOP-run Senate was seated in January, but was now claiming publicly that it was Democrats who prolonged the confirmation by waiting until 2015. The White House spokesman said he is often asked if McConnell 'is a man of his word.' This incident is not 'a very good sign of faith,' Earnest proclaimed. Ironically, Republicans' strategy to force a vote in support of the sex trafficking legislation before taking a vote on Lynch's nomination prolongs the departure of one of their least favorite Obama administration officials from the president's service: Eric Holder, pictured here to the left of the president. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid chimed in on Monday and said that McConnell 'gave his word' that Lynch would receive fair consideration. 'Now he's hedging on that,' Reid said during a speech on the Senate floor. 'Republicans simply can't govern,' Reid, the Senate's majority leader until Republican took over in January, argued. McConnell's spokesman Don Stewart blamed the trafficking bill kerfuffle on Democrats in a statement provided to the Associated Press. And given White House's hesitancy to issue a veto, he said, the president, not McConnell, should ask his party members to swallow a version of the bill it doesn't entirely agree with. 'They need to choose between a partisan filibuster and the pleas of thousands of abused children across the country,' Stewart said. 'And they need to do it soon.' Ironically, Republicans' strategy to force a vote in support of the sex trafficking legislation before taking a vote on Lynch's nomination prolongs the departure of one of their least favorite Obama administration officials from the president's service: Eric Holder. Earnest confirmed today that Holder will remain on the job,‘gettin' up early and workin' late,' as long as is 'necessary.'

    The Senate majority leader won't allow a vote on Loretta Lynch's confirmation until the Senate passes a sex trafficking bill .
Democrats are refusing to support the once bipartisan measure over a provision limiting funding for abortions .
Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest said the confirmation vote delay reflected 'inept leadership' on McConnell's part and suggested the White House could no longer trust congressional Republicans .
Spat is the latest indication that the respective goodwill professed by the White House and GOP leaders after November's elections is curdling .
Summarized text: 
    The White House blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday for holding up the confirmation of President Barack Obama's nominee for attorney general, saying it calls into question his leadership abilities. The delay comes after New York prosecutor Loretta Lynch said over weekend that he wouldn’t allow a vote on Lynch until they finish resolving dissenting provisions in the bipartisan human trafficking bill - which Democrats are refusING to support despite limiting funding for abortions and other sex abuses

    For centuries there have been accounts of animals behaving bizarrely before earthquakes. Now, for the first time, scientists have filmed the behaviour of wild animals prior to a quake and believe their study could help improve short-term seismic forecasting. They found that animals in Peru - such as pumas and razor-billed curassow birds - ran for cover days before the event. Researchers believe that the changes in behaviour may be linked to airborne ions. Scroll down for video . For the first time, scientists have filmed the behaviour of wild animals in Peru prior to a quake and believe their study could help improve short-term seismic forecasting. This still shows a Razor-billed curassow . Led by Dr Rachel Grant of Anglia Ruskin University, experts used data gathered from a series of motion-triggered cameras located in the Yanachaga National Park in Peru. The research found that significant changes in animal behaviour began 23 days before the magnitude 7.0 Contamana earthquake that struck the region in 2011. On a typical day, the cameras would record between five and 15 animal sightings. However, within the 2-day period in the run-up to the earthquake, they recorded five or fewer sightings. For five of the seven days immediately before the earthquake, no animal movements were recorded at all, which was incredibly unusual for the mountainous rainforest region. Dr Grant, a lecturer in animal and environmental biology, told MailOnline that rodents seemed to be particularly sensitive and disappeared completely eight days before the quake. ‘Usually they’re quite ubiquitous in the forest. They’re very common and were everywhere in the control period, but then completely disappeared.’ The research found that significant changes in animal behaviour began 23 days before the magnitude 7.0 Contamana earthquake struck the region in 2011. A stock image showing rupture caused by a quake is shown . Scientists recorded the reflection of very low frequency radio waves above the area surrounding the epicentre of the Peruvian earthquake. In particualr they monitored the ionosphere, the layer of the Earth's atmosphere which contains a high concentration of ions and free electrons and is able to reflect radio waves. It is thought that positive airborne ions, which are known to be generated in large numbers at the Earth’s surface when rocks deep below are subjected to increasing stresses during the build-up to an earthquake, trigger unusual animal behaviour. Positive ions in the air lead to unpleasant side effects in animals and humans, such as ‘serotonin syndrome’. This is caused by an increase in the serotonin levels in the bloodstream, and can lead to symptoms such as restlessness, agitation, hyperactivity and confusion. The study which was co-authored by Professor Friedemann Freund of the SETI Institute and Professor Jean-Pierre Raulin of the Centre of Radio Astronomy and Astrophysics Mackenzie (CRAAM) in Brazil, and is published by the journal Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, looked at reasons for this disappearance. They recorded the reflection of very low frequency (VLF) radio waves above the area surrounding the epicentre. The scientists detected disturbances in the ionosphere - the layer of the earth's atmosphere which contains a high concentration of ions and free electrons and is able to reflect radio waves - which started two weeks before the earthquake. A particularly large fluctuation was recorded eight days prior to the quake, coinciding with the second significant decrease in animal activity observed in the pre-earthquake period. Prominent among the most likely causes for the unusual animal response are positive airborne ions, which are known to be generated in large numbers at the Earth’s surface when rocks deep below are subjected to increasing stresses during the build-up to an earthquake. Positive ions in the air lead to unpleasant side effects in animals and humans, such as ‘serotonin syndrome’. This is caused by an increase in the serotonin levels in the bloodstream, and can lead to symptoms such as restlessness, agitation, hyperactivity and confusion. They expected the injection of positive airborne ions into the Earth’s atmosphere before seismic activity to have a profound effect on mammals and birds - in particular those living on the ground and in burrows, and the study seems to prove this. Dr Grant, a lecturer in animal and environmental biology, told MailOnline that rodents seemed to be particularly sensitive and disappeared completely eight days before the quake. This still from an in-situ camera shows a Paca rodent during the control period of the experiment . Experts led by Dr Rachel Grant of Anglia Ruskin University used data gathered from a series of motion-triggered cameras located in the Yanachaga National Park in Peru (marked on the map) ‘As far as we know, this is the first time that motion triggered cameras have documented this phenomenon prior to an earthquake,’ Dr Grant said. ‘The results are particularly interesting as we also found evidence of disturbances in the ionosphere in the area where the earthquake struck. ‘We believe that both of these anomalies arise from a single cause: seismic activity causing stress build-up in the earth’s crust, leading, among other things, to massive air ionisation. Professor Friedemann Freund of the Seti Institute, who works at Nasa’s Ames Research Centre in California, added: ‘The camera traps were located on a ridge at an altitude of 900 metres. ‘If air ionisation occurred, it is likely that it was particularly strong along such a ridge. ‘Hence, the animals would have escaped to the valley below, where they were exposed to fewer positive airborne ions. Prominent among the most likely causes for the unusual animal response are positive airborne ions, which are known to be generated in large numbers at the Earth’s surface when rocks deep below are subjected to increasing stresses during the build-up to an earthquake. A puma is captured in this image before the quake . ‘With their acute ability to sense their environment, animals can help us understand subtle changes that occur before major earthquakes,' said Professor Friedemann Freund of the Seti Institute. This aerial view shows the tectonic uplift along a fault in Iran . ‘With their acute ability to sense their environment, animals can help us understand subtle changes that occur before major earthquakes. ‘These changes, that we are now able to measure, express themselves in many different ways at the earth’s surface and above.’ Dr Grant said that that next step in the research is to find a reproducible way of monitoring behavioural changes before an earthquake, because ‘we don’t want a false alarm’. She intends to investigate wither zooplankton – tiny animals that live in water – could be used as a biological indicator for seismic activity. ‘We hope our work will stimulate further research into this area, which has the potential to help with short-term seismic risk forecasting,’ she added. As well as predicting earthquakes, animals could help repair the damage they cause too. In November last year, researchers at North Carolina State University fitted cockroaches with electrical 'backpacks' complete with tiny microphones to detect the faintest of sounds. The idea is that cyborg cockroaches, or ‘biobots’, could enter crumpled buildings hit by earthquakes, for example, and help emergency workers find survivors. ‘In a collapsed building, sound is the best way to find survivors,’ said Alper Bozkurt, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the university. ‘The goal is to use the biobots with high-resolution microphones to differentiate between sounds that matter - like people calling for help - from sounds that don't matter - like a leaking pipe. Rise of the robo-roach: Scientists have developed technology that allows cyborg cockroaches, or biobots (pictured) to pick up sounds with small microphones and seek out the source of the sound. They could one day be used in emergency situations to detect survivors . ‘Once we've identified sounds that matter, we can use the biobots equipped with microphone arrays to zero-in on where those sounds are coming from.’ The ‘backpacks’ control the robo-roach's movements because they are wired to the insect’s cerci - sensory organs that cockroaches usually use to feel if their abdomens brush against something. By electrically stimulating the cerci, cockroaches can be prompted to move in a certain direction. In fact, they have been programmed to seek out sound. One type of 'backpack' is equipped with an array of three directional microphones to detect the direction of the sound and steer the biobot in the right direction towards it. Another type is fitted with a single microphone to capture sound from any direction, which can be wirelessly transmitted - perhaps in the future to emergency workers. They ‘worked well’ in lab tests and the experts have developed technology that can be used as an ‘invisible fence’ to keep the biobots in a certain area such as a disaster area, the researchers announced at the IEEE Sensors 2014 conference in Valencia, Spain. A previous study led by Dr Edgar Lobaton, who is also at the university, showed that biobots can be used to map a disaster area. Dr Lobaton and Professor Bozkurt plan on merging their research to both map disaster areas and pinpoint survivors.

    A WWII veteran died a hero  after pushing his wife of 68 years out of the way from an oncoming car. Clark and Betty Biddle, both 88, were high school sweethearts in Ohio. She had waited for him while he served in the army. They had two children, a dog and a vegetable garden. But their  love story took a tragic turn last Thursday as the couple walked across a shopping center to meet high school friends for their monthly lunch reunion. WWII veteran Clark Biddle died a hero after pushing Betty, his wife of 68 years, out of the way from an oncoming car. They were high school sweethearts in Columbus, Ohio . Betty had broken her hip two years ago, and was relying on her husband and a walker to help her move that day. When Clark saw that she was in danger as a car began backing out of a parking space, he didn't hesitate. Betty was bruised, but Clark had been struck. He fell and hit his head, suffering massive brain trauma. He passed away two days later. 'I don't know if I'm going to make it without him,' Betty told the Columbus Dispatch. Betty said she misses Clark 'every minute', and kisses the picture that she carries around of the two of them, sitting at the kitchen table together, 'a number of times a day'. She said she will never get over the sight of seeing her husband on the ground. Betty said she misses Clark 'every minute', and kisses the picture that she carries around of the two of them, sitting at the kitchen table together, 'a number of times a day' Betty said she will never get over the sight of seeing her husband on the ground and that sometimes she wishes she was with him . 'Sometimes I wish I was with him, I really do,' she said. Gary Biddle, the couple's son, said his father was acting on instinct when he saved Betty. He had been her primary caregiver ever since her injury two years ago. 'This is dad, he would sacrifice himself for others and always cared for them, more than thinking about himself,' he told the Columbus Dispatch. Clark was a pilot. He also opened and owned a drive-in restaurant bearing his name for 25 years, and played the saxophone and clarinet for dance bands. He was a well-known member of his community, unable to go to the grocery store without running into people he knew, according to his son-in-law Dan Cress. Clark was also a friendly neighbor. Laura Jones told the Columbus Dispatch that he would let her dog out every day while she was at work after her husband died six years ago. And, without fail, there was always a note and two cookies  waiting for her when she got home. Columbus police said the driver of the car is currently under investigation.

    She credits her as her ‘greatest inspiration’ – yet the one person model-turned-artist Tali Lennox has never painted is her popstar mother Annie. The 22-year-old, who is preparing for her first solo art exhibition in New York, has received critical acclaim. But in an exclusive interview with The Scottish Mail on Sunday, she revealed she had still not plucked up the courage to capture the Eurythmics star on canvas. Scroll down for video . Tali, right, pictured with her Eurythmics singer mother, Annie Lennox, is preparing for her first art exhibition . She said: ‘She is one of the only people I haven’t painted. I haven’t built myself up to it yet. ‘I am such a perfectionist and I worry that it might not turn out as amazing as I would want it to. She is so important to me and I want it to be just right.’ Last week the 22-year-old faced criticism for posting self portraits of herself as a bruised and bloodied victim of domestic violence online . She has painted her close friends, her sister, even her boyfriend, New York-based photographer Ian Jones: ‘I like to paint people I know rather than strangers, as I have a deeper understanding of their expressions and what each one means. ‘I will paint my mum at some point. The last time I was with her we were talking about it. I am thinking I might do a series, in different situations, that capture different sides of her.’ The youngest daughter of the Scottish singer and her second husband, Israeli film producer Uri Fruchtmann, Tali grew up in London’s Notting Hill. Yet despite her high-profile parents, she describes her upbringing as ‘sheltered’, saying: ‘People find it hard to believe, but my childhood was really quite normal. ‘My mum has always been so modest and grounded and didn’t really involve herself in the world of celebrity. First and foremost, despite being an incredibly successful singer, she was a parent. ‘I never felt we were under a spotlight and we didn’t have paparazzi trailing us all the time, which I am grateful for. ‘I think because we didn’t do anything out of the ordinary we were left alone and that helped me growing up. I didn’t really feel any different to anyone else.’ It was only when Tali and her older sister Lola first accompanied her on a world tour that they realised just how fêted their mother was. ‘I remember, during her performances, seeing people crying in the crowd and I was like: “Woah, they must really love her”. Thousands of people would be singing along to her music – I think it was then that it hit home to me how famous she was.’ Tali would later go into modelling, starring in big budget campaigns for Burberry and Prada. Two years ago, she put her modelling career on hold to move to the US and become a professional portrait artist. But still makes sure she speaks to her mother every day: ‘I love to talk to her about what I am doing. I don’t always listen to other people’s feedback on my art, but with my mum I do listen. ‘We are really similar and we think in the same way. I am so lucky to have someone in my life who I am so so close to in that way and who really gets me. I never feel embarrassed showing my mum my work, even self-portraits that are quite raw. ‘Both my parents have always supported me and encouraged me to do what I love.’ Her self-portrait show, Layers of Life, opens next week at the Catherine Ahnell Gallery in New York’s trendy SoHo area. Tali has inherited her mother’s love of pushing the boundaries and some of her paintings have sparked controversy. Art Attack: Tali Lennox prepares for her first solo exhibition at the Catherine Ahnell gallery in Soho New York . Last week, she faced criticism that some of her self-portraits, which showed her as a bruised and bleeding victim of domestic abuse, were in ‘very poor taste’. Yesterday, speaking from her studio in New York, the young artist, whose mother actively campaigns for women’s rights, explained that she wanted to shine a light on ‘every trait of human nature’. She said: ‘It is so important that we do not hide away from important issues such as domestic abuse. We have to face up to it if we are going to stop it. ‘There is far too much abuse in the world. My mother campaigns on the issue and the most recent figures are really shocking. 'I know some people may find my work quite intense, but I want to make emotive art. I want to make people feel something and look inside themselves. I want to evoke compassion and discussion. ‘In a world where everything is instant and accessible, and people put out fragments of themselves on social media, I search for moments of authenticity and am inspired by those who strive to be who they are. I am not putting my work out thinking everyone has to like it. Art is in the eye of the beholder.’ Tali has been drawing and painting for ‘as long as I can remember’. While she admits she loves to sing, and would watch her mother with admiration as she belted out songs at the grand piano that took pride of place in the family home, her sketch book was always at her side. The model turned artists said that art has always been her passion since a young age . Her ‘unexpected’ move into modelling at 17 changed the way she looked at beauty. ‘I had singing lessons at school but my parents were never pushy,’ she said. ‘I love singing and am not bad at it, but I don’t think I have what it takes to make a career out of it. ‘Art has always been my passion, since I was very young – it is like meditation and the feeling of satisfaction and closure you get when you complete a painting cannot be beaten. I have always painted people. When I was younger I used to like drawing pretty girls from magazines but as I got older, after I started modelling and was in a world obsessed with looks, I started to prefer more distorted faces which have more depth.’ The 5ft 10in beauty admits it was the pressure to look a certain way that turned her off modelling full-time. ‘I still do some modelling, but not as much as I used to,’ she said. ‘I want to work on something I created, whereas when you are modelling you are part of someone else’s idea. ‘In modelling, your one main ambition is to look after the way you look. It is not something I felt I could immerse myself in full-time – plus I like eating nice food too much.’ She added: ‘A part of modelling is great and fun, but it is also about chance and whether someone wants you and that brings a lot of pressure. You can feel a bit insecure. Maybe in a way it is selfish, but I needed to find a better balance for me. Tali admits it was the pressure to look a certain was that finally turned her off modelling . ‘I had never planned to model. It was all quite bizarre how it happened and I was very young but it taught me so much about myself and I met some amazing people.’ Tali hopes her exhibition will show the world she is more than just a ‘privileged’ girl who likes to paint. She said: ‘I am not in this for the fame, that is not important to me, but I would like people to see my paintings and realise how hard I work. I know I have had a very privileged life, but it is important to me I am not put in a box and am seen as more than the daughter of a famous singer. Sometimes you hear people questioning why the children of actors and singers don’t just get “normal” jobs. But when you grow up in an artistic environment, this is normal. ‘I also think it is in your genes. People are pleasantly surprised when they see that I am not a cliché and I take my work really seriously. I felt it was important for me to fly the nest and come to New York on my own and be self-sufficient.’ But she has never felt she was in her mother’s shadow. ‘I am so proud of what she has done in her life. I am so grateful to have such an incredible, passionate, giving person in my life. I was talking to her the other day about all her humanitarian work. She just never stops and does everything with the best of intentions.’ The singer plans to be at the opening of her daughter’s exhibition. Tali said: ‘She is my greatest inspiration and I am so glad she will be there. All those closest to me will be – which means a lot.’ Tali revealed she has also been taking acting lessons, saying: ‘I love acting. It is similar to painting as you use yourself as the tool and it is scary because it all comes from within. To be successful you have to give your everything to it – so I don’t think I could commit enough time just now with my art – but I haven’t ruled it out.’ Wistfully, she adds: ‘I can’t see myself in a comedy. I like things that are honest and raw, so I think the best acting is method acting for me.’ l The Layers of Life exhibition will be open for a month from March 19 at the Catherine Ahnell Gallery in New York.

    A sister who lost her brother in the Afghan War has married the soldier who tried in vain to save his life. Private Gregg Stone, 20, was shot dead on 3rd June 2012, while on a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman kidnapped by the Taliban. Liam Fisher, 22,  tried valiantly to save his comrade, and was lucky to survive himself after a bullet hit his helmet as he dragged his dying friend into a ditch, before lying on top of him to protect him. Rosie-Ann Stone has married Private Liam Fisher, who risked his own life trying to save her fatally injured brother in Afghanistan . But he could not be saved, and the young soldier died of his wounds at the scene. His sister Rosie-Ann Stone, of Atwick, near Hornsea, East Yorkshire, heard of Pte Fisher's bravery at her brother's inquest and the couple stayed in touch by exchanging Facebook messages. They soon realised they were falling for each other and the couple got engaged last November. The Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, was so moved by the story of the family that he granted a special licence for the couple to marry in York Minster in a moving ceremony held yesterday. Leading the service yesterday, the Revd Canon Michael Smith, Pastor of the Minster, told the 40 guests: . 'I know some of you have been to some really dark and painful places. Love is about being prepared to make sacrifices for the person or people we love. Private Gregg Stone (left), 20, was shot dead on 3rd June 2012, while on a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman kidnapped by the Taliban.  The Stone family were struck by tragedy again when Rosie-Ann's sister, Jennie, 28, (right) was killed in a car crash . 'We remember those unable to come here today and are not here. We remember in God's presence Gregg and Jennie. 'We remember those lines that "Love never dies". 'We remember them and all our loved ones who have died as they share with is this day and our prayers.' The Stone family were struck by tragedy again when Rosie-Ann's sister, Jennie, 28, was killed in a car crash in Fraisthorpe. Rosie-Ann was involved in the fatal incident and prosecuted for causing death through careless driving, but was later unanimously acquitted by a jury at Hull Crown Court. Rosie-Ann said before the wedding: 'We are so happy. Gregg would be giddy. He would be shocked, but he'd be so pleased. Mum and Dad say they feel as though Gregg sent Liam to me.

Rosie-Ann said before the wedding: 'We are so happy. Gregg would be giddy. He would be shocked, but he'd be so pleased. Mum and Dad say they feel as though Gregg sent Liam to me' Rosie-Ann and Liam met at Gregg's inquest in Hull in May 2013. After exchanging Facebook messages, the couple had their first date . 'When we got together, people were sceptical. 'People thought, "Is she just looking for comfort?" or "Is she just looking for a replacement brother?" 'But our relationship is founded on merit. I love Liam for everything he is. He is genuine. 'People contact you when there is tragedy, saying they'll support you. Liam was different. 'He just wanted to get to know me. It was really refreshing.' Rosie-Ann and Liam met at Gregg's inquest in Hull in May 2013. After exchanging Facebook messages, the couple had their first date in Bridlington the following August. Pte Fisher at first did not even tell his new love about his Task Force Helmand commander's bravery commendation for trying to save her brother. Describing Gregg's final moments, he said: 'It was chaos. It was jungle. You couldn't see anything. 'The platoon commander told us to keep 10m apart, but I turned to Gregg and said, 'It's 5m for me and you'. Then the rounds came flying.' He added: 'I'm sure Gregg would have sat me down and grilled me. He would have told me to look after his little sister, but he would be pleased.' Rosie-Ann's parents said they were over the moon when the engagement was announced. Her father Bob said: 'I can't put into words, without getting overwhelmed and emotional, how I feel', while mother Angie added: 'We feel we have gained a son.'

    (CNN)With majorities in both chambers of Congress, it is time for Republicans to begin rolling back six years of failed Obama administration policies. Our highest priority during the ongoing budget debate should be undoing the damage caused by defense sequestration and the hundreds of billions of dollars of defense cuts made by the Obama administration. Regrettably, military strength is seen in many quarters as the cause of military adventurism. A strong, robust defense is seen not to deter aggression, but to provoke it. For years, we have systematically underfunded our military, marrying a philosophy of retreat with a misplaced understanding of our larger budgetary burdens and the real drivers of the debt: our entitlement programs. As expected, almost four years after the passage of the Budget Control Act, virtually nothing has been done to address the unsustainable growth of our entitlement programs, while essential defense programs have been sacrificed. Political leaders in Washington need to be reminded that our defense is the single most important responsibility of the federal government. Instead of starting the process by setting arbitrary defense spending levels and then forcing our military to cut vital programs in order to meet these levels, the budgeting process should start by taking into account all the threats against us, listing the programs and capabilities we'll need to protect our people and interests around the world, and then funding those efforts. Even though we've been able to keep the homeland safe for more than a decade, the threats to Americans at home and abroad are growing.  From the rise of the Islamic State and the spread of Islamic terrorism, to Russia's aggression in Europe, to Chinese expansionism in the South China Sea, the threats to American security are growing. Yet, even as the world outside our borders is filled with more doubt and uncertainty, the United States has been steadily reducing our spending on defense. Even before sequestration, President Obama made defense cuts of $487 billion over 10 years and redirected the savings to already bloated domestic programs. This was followed by tens of billions more in defense cuts each year because of sequestration, which, when combined with Obama's prior cuts, will total $1 trillion over the coming decade. All of these reductions were enacted despite the warnings of four secretaries of defense and our entire military leadership. The results of these cuts have been disastrous for our military and for our ability to project power and deter our enemies. The slight increase in President Obama's proposed 2016 budget won't significantly change that. At the end of this process, our military will be significantly smaller, dramatically less capable and dangerously unready to deploy if these budget cuts remain in place. The Army is on the path to be reduced to pre-World War II levels. The Navy is at pre-WWI levels. And our Air Force has the smallest and oldest combat force in its history. Our force reductions have been felt throughout the world -- by our friends and our enemies. They have presented not just a crisis of readiness for America, but also a perilous strategic weakness. Our adversaries have been emboldened by what they perceive as our diminished military presence. History has shown that every time we have unreasonably cut resources from our military in anticipation of a peace dividend, it has only cost us more to make up for the deficit we create in military readiness and capability, and the expected era of perpetual peace fails to materialize. We think we are saving money, but in the long run, we end up paying more and creating more risk and uncertainty. We can afford the military we need, but we must make it a priority. For this reason, we introduced an amendment to the Senate budget resolution this week to address the dangerous funding gap our military currently faces. We believe we must increase the resources available to our military to the levels proposed by (former) Defense Secretary Robert Gates in his FY12 budget, the last defense budget based solely on an assessment of the threats we face and the requisite military needs to deal with those threats. It is the budget that the bipartisan, congressionally-mandated National Defense Panel stated was "the minimum required to reverse course and set the military on a more stable footing." Now that Republicans control both house of Congress, it is time to support a defense budget that actually reflects the world in which we live, not the world the way we wish it was. Until now, our approach as a country and a party since the Budget Control Act has not been one of American strength. Continuing on the current path will only invite war and conflict through weakness. We need to heed the bipartisan warnings of our nation's military leaders and get back on track toward a defense budget that reflects the realities of the challenges we face and is worthy of our brave men and women in uniform.  In the end, it is they who will suffer the most if sequestration is not reversed and our readiness and equipment continues to degrade. As members of Congress, we have a sacred obligation to ensure that they have the best possible training and equipment so they can successfully complete their missions. Despite the fiscal constraints imposed on our military, they are doing their part and are holding up their end of the bargain. It's time that we hold up ours.

    Chloe Sevigny has posed with just a lobster covering her modesty. Save her fashion jacket and mirror sandals, the 40-year-old can be seen on the cover of the Marfa Journal stark naked and sprawling out over a retro kitchen work top. The actress, who is considered an influencer within many fashion circles, makes a series of bizarre statements from a nun in chain underwear to scantily-clad Red Riding Hood as she creates four fake movie posters for the magazine. WARNING: EXPLICIT CONTENT . Claws for draws: Choe Sevigny ditches her underwear for new Marfa Journal pictures as she poses with a lobster over her crotch . The four fake billboards divide the whole magazine into four sections: raw, decadent, romantic and progressive. And they're sure to get attention, though loyal fans' interest in the content may be waning as the shoot sees the Swedish actress in a whole new light. Golden Globe winning and Academy Award nominated Chloe has previously enjoyed roles in Boys Don't Cry and American Psycho but these latest roles appear to put her in an all new-genre. In the most shocking image of the four book quarters, the beauty ditches her underwear in favour of the large marine crustacean. Stark naked: Besides a long fashion coat and a belt, Chloe was stark naked in the snaps . Provocative: Chloe posed on her knees wearing knickers and a chain between her legs . The fashionista was not without her accessories nonetheless and layered on some tribal beads between her bare chest and accentuated her enviable waist with a studded belt. She was seen sporting a subtle plaid coat, tying her tresses into a fuss-free low bun as she posed in a derelict kitchen setting. While it is not believed that the lobster is real, PETA's Managing Director Ingrid E. Newkirk told MailOnline: 'We're too kind to say what a pity it is that the lobster wasn't alive and wearing knuckledusters. 'So all we'll say is that we hope one day Chloë will realise how inferior she seems compared to a little animal who was killed just to cover a t**t. Fashionista: The fashion darling was still styled to perfection in Jean Paul Gaultier and Chanel Cruise . Daring: The actress appeared to poke fun at the movie industry with a series of mock film posters . Chloe, going virginal in white for a second picture, shows off her youthful frame in a second poster while dressed in a nun costume and headscarf. The title reads, 'Two Times A Virgin' and she sports lace knickers with a padlock and chain between her thighs to pose provocatively on her knees. Stylist Haley Wollens uses Chanel Cruise to dress the famous style star, as the cover caption indicates, with other credits including Proenza Schouler and Jean Paul Gaultier. Chloe, photographed by Brianna Capozzi, enjoys a throwback moment in velvet for one snap and adds a sexy edge to a red cape for another Running With Wolves mock up. Baring her rock hard stomach, the actress sums it up perfectly as she scrawls 'I put the HOT in PSYCHOTIC' across her abs while puffing on a cigarette. Youthful: The star looked sensational with her trim shape on show in a vintage costume . Fashion fan: Stylist Haley Wollens used Chanel Cruise to dress the famous style star with other credits including Proenza Schouler and Jean Paul Gaultier.

Third issue: The Marfa Journal is a bi-annual European publication that combines of art and fashion . And the cheeky starlet certainly does look hot. Youthful beyond her 40 years, the fashion darling shoots a full view of her bare behind, on which a temporary cherry tattoo can be seen in another daring image. Chloe clashes her moods as she sports a sweet, white bonnet but pulls down her tights to reveal her derriere while leaning over a dirt bike. Bi-annual European publication, Marfa Journal, combines of art and fashion and is now in its third issue, edited by Alexandra Gordienko. Movies appear to be the hot topic for Chloe at the moment, after she publicly named and shamed her favourite (and detested) female movie stars this week. The blonde hit out at Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence in the spring issue of V magazine. She said: ‘I love when a movie star is a great movie star. I think Angelina is a great movie star. ‘I like Emma Stone. Whenever she’s herself, she’s really cute. Jennifer Lawrence I find annoying. Too crass.’ Cheeky: The model and actress bent over a dirt bike in her crystal whites, including a bonnet . Wild one: She didn't managed a smile but instead a moody stare while showing off her bare bottom . 'So much is about marketing and selling the product,' the star continued. And her latest photo shoot appears to be yet further poking fun at the movie industry. Moving away from Hollywood, Chloe's latest career move is her sixth collection in collaboration with Opening Ceremony. The Spring/Summer 2015 womenswear line is themed around preppy chic, inspired by the satirical ’80s cult film Heathers. Sassy: Chloe was modelling in a leotard and pointed boots with Hello Kitty designs . Retro: She enjoyed seventies styling in a patterned jumpsuit and long mermaidian locks . Magazine star: Four fake movie posters divide the whole magazine into four sections: Raw, Decadent, Romantic and Progressive .

    (CNN)Six months ago this week Omar received a panicked phone call from his friend and fellow student. "I was in my dormitory writing a paper and a friend called me in desperation from a bus. He said they were being shot by police," Omar explained. He has not heard from his friend since. Omar is a student at the Raúl Isidro Burgos Rural Teacher Training College of Ayotzinapa, in Guerrero state. His friend is one of 43 students who were subjected to enforced disappearance in September of 2014. As the days and weeks passed, the Mexican authorities stalled and obfuscated. Despite worldwide attention on the issue, they have, for months, failed to properly investigate all lines of the case, especially the worrying allegations of complicity by armed forces. In January, I traveled to the Ayotzinapa college. There, in the college hall, surrounded by murals of Mexico's revolutionary leaders, I met the families of the disappeared students. For the past six months, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers, as well as other relatives and community members, have been campaigning relentlessly, demanding answers from the authorities about what happened to their loved ones. It was an emotional and difficult meeting; there were tears of sadness and disappointment. Mothers and fathers spoke of counting the seconds since they last saw their sons, and expressed frustration at how they and their boys have been portrayed as troublemakers by the authorities and the media. These are people who have lived in poverty, whose communities have been historically abandoned by the state; for many, their missing son was the first of their families to go to school. Now, so many hopes and dreams have been shattered. I have witnessed all kinds of human tragedies, but there can be few things as painful as the torment of not knowing where a loved one is. The past months have been a roller-coaster for these families, and all of us who support and accompany their struggles. But a constant factor has been the Mexican government's failure to respond effectively and address these grave human rights violations. A prime example of this is how, on November 7, 2014, the authorities announced that human remains had been uncovered in a rubbish dump and a nearby river in Cocula, and the then-attorney general Jesús Murillo Karam announced weeks later that he was prepared to close the case. According to the prosecutor, he was satisfied that the findings of his office's investigation were sufficient proof of what happened. However, only one of the missing students has been identified through DNA tests. Other human remains are still being tested, and it seems that the whole investigation so far has been based only on the testimonies of three gang members. You don't have to be attorney general to know that this is far from conclusive proof. But amidst the sadness of the families I met, there was a calm and steely resolve. These 43 mothers and fathers have decided they cannot accept the silence or half-answers they have been given by the government, instead they are demanding the truth. One father explained to me how the horror of that day has transformed them all from peasant farmers to detectives and campaigners. If the authorities won't push for proper investigations, then they will. They have been campaigning vocally for the truth ever since. The tragic reality is that these 43 students were only the most recent we have heard of in a long line of the disappeared. According to official figures, 24,748 people have disappeared or gone missing in Mexico since 2007, and almost half of them during the current administration of President Peña Nieto. Fortunately the international community has stepped up. Recently the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights established a Group of Independent Experts to review the official investigation into the enforced disappearance of the students. In February, the United Nations' Committee on Enforced Disappearances produced recommendations on how to deal with disappearances in Mexico. The committee concluded that there is a context of generalized disappearances in a great part of the country. It has asked the government to prevent acts of intimidation and harassment toward the families of the disappeared and has suggested setting up a DNA database of missing people and a registry of disappearances. However, even these international calls are going unheeded. Just hours after the U.N. committee published its conclusions and recommendations, the Mexican government disregarded them. This is a worrying sign that the government is not stepping up and taking this human rights crisis seriously. On March 3, Mexico appointed Arely Gómez González as the new federal attorney general. We had hoped that she would forge on where her predecessor failed and get to the root of the corruption and impunity that lies behind this terrible tragedy. However, her recent statements -- that the disappearance of the 43 students is an "isolated case" and that there is no confirmation of grave human rights violations in this case -- are shocking. For Omar and the others waiting for news, it is only full accountability and pursuit of justice that can address the horrors they have seen and experienced. "The government's response has been nothing but disrespectful and insensitive," Omar said. "I'm alarmed about what happened but I'm not afraid. We will never give up our fight for justice." Amnesty International and I will be there alongside them every step of the way.

    Everyone who meets Brian Maixner is greeted with a huge laugh and an even bigger smile. Only the waiter and single dad from Wichita, Kansas, has struggled with dental issues since he was a child, after chipping one of his front teeth lead to a series of infections that he has never been able to get on top of. It was something that struck Fred Boettcher, an attorney from Oklahoma, who was in town catching up with his daughter at the Doo-Dah Diner, where Maixner works. 'I took one look at this young man and knew he was something special,' Boettcher told KWCH 12. 'He carried himself with such kindness and confidence with a mouth that looked painful. I was struck by that.' Problem: Waiter Brian Maixner has suffered severe dental decay across his mouth since he was a child, but could not afford to have it fixed . Ongoing issues: Maixner, a single father, said his dental problems started when he chipped a front tooth at a child, leading to a variety of other issues he hasn't been able to afford to get fixed . Boettcher decided he wanted to help Maixner, who was until that point a complete stranger. He went over and spoke to Maixner's manager, and told her he was leaving behind a $25,000 tip to help him get a new set of teeth. 'This man doesn't know me and this is something I could never afford to do for myself,' Maixner said, admitting he burst into tears when his manager told him the news. 'It touched me so much that he cared.' The grand gesture came at no surprise to Boettcher's daughter. 'Dad gives so much, I remember him buying groceries for people in need when we were growing up,' Meredith Boettcher Young said. New reason to smile: Last week Maixner underwent a number of procedures and now has a whole new set of teeth, thanks to the generosity of a random customer . Overjoyed: 'This has been a complete life changer,' Brian Maixner said of his new chompers . Kind-hearted: Fred Boettcher was visiting his daughter Meredith (pictured together) in Wichita when he noticed Maixner and decided he wanted to help . Before: Brian Maixner had always been self-concious of his smile, growing up with teeth problems that had lasted well into adulthood, but that has changed thanks to customer Fred Boettcher (left) New man: After years of painful dental problems, Brian Maixner got thousands of dollars of work done on his teeth—all without paying a penny, thanks to a generous diner who wanted to help . Maixner has since undergone a number of procedures and now has a complete new set of top front teeth. The dental work has changed his life, he says, with friends, family and regular customers shocked at the difference it has made. However no one seems happier about what happened than the person responsible, Boettcher. No matter what religion you might be or whether you even believe in an after life the way to be satisfied in your life is to be kind to everybody and be as generous as you possibly can be," Boettcher said. 'As happy as that fella may be it feels so much better to be able to put a smile on his face.'

    A mansion which was hailed as Scotland's most expensive new home and advertised for £8million has been sold for less than £1million. Prospective buyers were told The Whitehouse at Gleneagles in Perthshire was a bargain despite the massive asking price when it was put on the market three years ago. The luxury home in an exclusive gated communities within the grounds of the Gleneagles Hotel and Golf Resort was described as a 'Great Gatsby-style' mansion with a blend of Georgian and Art Deco styles. The five-bedroom Whitehouse (pictured) was billed as 'Scotland's most expensive new home' and advertised at £8million (artist's impression) When building of the luxury home stalled after a buyer could not be found, the house sold for a knockdown price of just £861,888 . The 13,000sq ft mansion was planned to come complete with its own swimming pool, orangery, soundproofed cinema, three-car garage and more than half an acre of garden. It was marketed to rich foreign golf fans but failed to attract a buyer and development work on it stalled before it was repossessed by a bank in 2013. Property records show it has now been sold to a local businessman for a knockdown price of £861,888. Part of the package includes free membership of the Gleneagles resort for two years, including golf and use of the luxury facilities. The five-bedroom luxury home was set to feature a s wimming pool, orangery and soundproofed cinema - but has yet to be completed . Property records show the Whitehouse has now been sold to a local businessman for a knockdown price of just £861,888 . The mansion is in the grounds of the world famous Gleneagles Hotel and Resort which boasts three championship golf courses . The house was expected to be ready for occupation ahead of the 2014 staging of the Ryder Cup match between Europe and the USA at Gleneagles. But as it was never completed last year estate agents Savills slashed the price to offers over £750,000 - one of the biggest price reductions in Scottish property history. When it was first advertised John Coleman, a partner with selling agents Smiths Gore, said despite the property's daunting price tag there should be no problem in attracting potential buyers across the globe. He said at the time: 'Not only is it architecturally stunning with state-of-the-art finishes and is a golf lover's dream, but at £500 per square foot it is a relative bargain, compared to other luxury properties worldwide which go for ten times that. 'In Hong Kong, the average price of luxury property is almost £7,000 per sq ft and in Mayfair in London sales are achieving £5,500 per sq ft. 'We are looking at people who want to buy something special at a golf hotel resort. 'Everything will be top spec. This is about buying the very best of what Scotland has to offer on the very best golf resort. We think, in world terms, this is good value for money.' The Whitehouse was the most expensive of the 14 homes planned to be built on Queen's Crescent - an exclusive gated community within the Gleneagles resort. Each of the plots was sold off for around £1m by the hotel owners. The house was meant to be ready for occupation ahead of the 2014 Ryder Cup match between Europe and the USA at Gleneagles . The world-famous hotel in Scotland has three championship courses, the King's Course, the Queen's Course and the Centenary Course as well as the nine hole 'Wee Course'. When it was opened in 1924, Gleneagles was described as 'a Riviera in the Highlands' and 'the eighth wonder of the world'. It most recently hosted the 2014 Ryder Cup which saw Team Europe beat Team USA 16½ to 11½ to complete a hat-trick of successive wins in the tournament. The hotel was built by the former Caledonian Railway Company, with its own railway station just minutes away, and is now owned by Diageo plc. In 1919 The King's and Queen's courses opened on the same day, but  The King's but was only nine holes until it was completed as a full 18 in 1925. When the Second World War broke out in 1939 the hotel closed and became a military hospital and then a miners' rehabilitation centre. It reopened as a hotel in May 1947. In 1993 the PGA Centenary Course, created by Jack Nicklaus, opened to complement the renowned King's and Queen's courses and form one of the world's finest golfing venues. The house was supposed to be ready for occupation ahead of the 2014 staging of the Ryder Cup match between Europe and the USA .

    (CNN)Ben Carson suggested to CNN on Wednesday that prisons can turn straight people gay. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee called being gay a lifestyle choice, like drinking alcohol. I guess the next thing these two presumed 2016 presidential hopefuls will tell America is being black is a choice, too. Like it or not, it's no wonder Jeb Bush is emerging as the Republican Party's 2016 frontrunner. Of course, there is that awkward little name thing, something he seems fully aware of -- despite only being in the exploratory phase of a potential campaign, Jeb has already declared he's not just another Bush.  "A lot of people know my dad, they know my brother. As in everybody's family, we're all a little different," he reportedly told a crowd in Las Vegas this week. And he seems to keep trying to distance himself from his family. "Do you have brothers and sisters? Are you exactly the same?" he insisted. Yet Jeb is banking hard on the same vault of donors and operatives his father George H. W Bush and his brother George W. Bush used in their presidential campaigns. He's already raising lots of money, asking donors recently not to give more than a still eye-popping $1 million to his super PAC. "They didn't need to be persuaded," Howard Leach, a Republican fundraiser for Jeb, told the Washington Post. So, what exactly is in a name like Bush? Apparently, a whole lot of cash, which helps win presidential nominations and elections. And if Jeb wins the nomination in 2016, it will likely be less "joyfully," as he promised last year, than ruthlessly. After all, we're still more than 18 months from the election and Jeb's locking in many of the same kinds of consultants that worked with his brother and father. "Those who hold out can sense a distinct chill," noted a recent New York Times article. Jeb's campaign is seeking to hire "donors, advisors and operatives," wrote the Times, with "deep connections to the Bush family's past presidential campaigns and administrations." Those same family members from whom Jeb swears he's different? And if consultants don't abide by Jeb's rules of loyalty and decide to work with other 2016 Republican aspirants? "Swift rebuke follows," the Times notes, pointing to the example of IMGE, a technology company that reportedly fell out of favor with the Bush campaign after one of the firm's founders indicated IMGE was hoping not to be tied to a single candidate. None of this is to suggest that Jeb Bush doesn't have appeal as a candidate -- I like some of the things he did as Florida governor, like his record of cutting $19 billion in taxes and supporting school choice programs. (Although I'm not a fan of his willingness to grant illegal immigrants amnesty in any shape, fashion or form.) He seems more equipped to lead America and get things done than some others in the already cramped horse race like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who seems more concerned with telling people off than sounding presidential. Then there's Rick Santorum and Huckabee, caring Christian men, but both too consumed with running for president of morality than bringing the entire country together after years of Obama supposedly dividing us on race, religion and sexuality. But what troubles me a little about Bush's early attempts at "corning the market" is that he's relying on the same consultants that have cycled through the last 20-plus years of elections -- some of whom worked for Romney's campaign. This raises the question of why, if Jeb doesn't want the public to view him as just another Bush running for president, he seems to be relying on the Bush network of consultants? The same playbook that helped get his brother and father get elected president isn't going to work for this Bush. The demographics of the country have changed, but it seems unlikely the Republican Party and its operatives have changed with it. The truth is that any Republican candidate who wins the nomination will have to refrain from business as usual. He (let's face it, the GOP won't nominate a woman) will have to hire minorities and women in meaningful campaign positions and have a strategy to aggressively compete for minority votes. This is something Romney didn't do nearly enough of. Jeb is only in the "pre-presidential" phase, ruminating over the idea. But he appears to be assembling a lot of the same old (white) faces of recent losing Republican campaigns we've seen before. As a black conservative who would like to see a Republican in the White House again, I hope Jeb isn't Romney 2.0.

    These are the property hotspots where you can buy a house and supposedly still have enough money left over each month to have a life. When looking at the average salary after tax and average mortgage repayments across the country, Canberra has topped the list with homeowners having $3,271 leftover each month. Sydneysiders are the worst off, according to calculations by comparison site Mozo.com.au. When looking at the average salary after tax and average mortgage repayments across the country, Canberra (pictured) has topped the list with homeowners having $3,271 leftover each month . Sydneysiders are the worst off, according to calculations by comparison site Mozo.com.au. Sydney (pictured) has high property prices and high mortgage repayments . 'The emerald city is suffering the most, with the average mortgage repayment now taking a whopping 63 per cent of the average after tax salary, leaving Sydneysiders with less than $2,000 each month to cover everything else,' Mozo director Kirsty Lamont said. 'Meanwhile, Canberrans are parting with 42 per cent of their salary, leaving the rest for expenses and lifestyle such as dining out, travel or saving for a rainy day.' Canberra’s high average salary of about $5,061, combined with an average property of about $510,000 means resident are left with more cash to spare than any other city. It is closely followed by Perth and then Hobart with homeowners having roughly $3,000 leftover each month. Perth (pictured) and then Hobart are next on the list with homeowners having $3,000 leftover each month . Hobart (pictured) has the lowest average income nationwide and it has the lowest property prices . Homeowners in Brisbane have roughly $2,835 leftover each month for expenses and lifestyle such as dining out, travel or saving for a rainy day . Perth has the nation's second highest income to help cover the mortgage, but Hobart has the lowest average income nationwide and it has low property prices. 'If you look at the proportion of salary going towards a mortgage, Hobart (36 percent), Adelaide (41 percent) and Canberra (42 percent) are the three cities having to put the lest of their income towards repayments,' Ms Lamont said. Sydney and Melbourne are not only slapped with high repayments, they’re also among the world’s top 10 most expensive cities. The average monthly salary for someone living in Adelaide is $4,641, while mortgage repayments are $1,914 . The average house price in Darwin is $530,000 and monthly mortgage repayments are around $2,474 . Sydney and Melbourne (pictured) are not only slapped with high repayments, they’re also among the world’s top 10 most expensive cities . They have $1,895 and $2,387 left over each month respectively. 'Big property prices mean big mortgages,' Ms Lamont said. 'Not usually known as the capital of fun, it looks like Canberra is where it’s at if you want to splash your extra cash and not be a slave to your mortgage.'
Summary target: 
    Canberra ranks  best place to buy a property and still have money leftover .
High average salary of $5,000 combined with average property price of $510,000 means they're left with more cash each moth .
Perth and Hobart follow with homeowners having roughly $3,000 leftover .
Sydney is worst off with high repayments and expensive house market .
Summarized text: 
    Canberra has topped the list when looking at the average salary after tax and average mortgage repayments across Australia. Sydneysider' are worst off with homeowners having $3,271 each month. Perth and Hobart are next on top with homeowners having roughly $3,000 leftover each monthly for expenses such as dining out or travelling to save for a rainy day in Brisbane - home prices are low compared to Sydney (36%) and Melbourne (42)

    As the classic Australian invention of the cask wine turns 50 this year, the best goon bags on offer are revealed. Many of us associate drinking from a shiny silver bladder as our cheap and nasty introduction to wine in our clueless youth - however casks have come a long way in the past half of a century. So much so that in 2015, one in every three glasses of wine drunk in Australia actually comes out of a cask. A stark contrast to back in 1973 when the cask hadn't taken off yet and drinking wine was only consumed on special occasions - hence each Aussie only drank about 9.8 litres of wine per year. This figure jumped to 19.3 litres per capita consumption over the next decade as people really got into the boxed varietal. Scroll down for video .

    Manor  had no intention of competing at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix and will pay a price for their failure to race, Formula One's ringmaster Bernie Ecclestone indicated on Monday. The struggling British-based team, who emerged from the remains of the failed Marussia outfit after going into administration and missing the last three races of 2014, failed to turn a wheel on the track in Melbourne. They missed all three practice sessions and Saturday qualifying, blaming software problems, which ruled them out of the race. Manor mechanics work on their car in Melbourne, but they failed to take part at any point over the weekend . British driver Will Stevens has been named one of Manor's drivers this term, and Graeme Lowdon (right) However, they escaped punishment with stewards deciding to take no action after an enquiry decided the team had made 'all reasonable endeavours' to get their cars ready. 'We should have never ever, ever allowed Manor to do what they've done. It's our fault. I predicted this would happen,' Ecclestone said. 'They had no intention of racing in Australia. Zero. They couldn't have raced if someone had gone there with a machine gun and put it to their head. 'It was impossible. So they had no intention. We'll have to see now. And they will have to pay their way to get there and get out of there,' he added. Bernie Ecclestone has indicated that Manor will pay the price for their no-show at the season opener . Marussia, who were ninth overall last season thanks to a ninth-place finish by Frenchman Jules Bianchi in Monaco, won a race against time to get their cars through crash tests and onto the air charter for Australia. Ecclestone said there had been no charge for the freight because they were entitled to that providing they were competing. 'They are not competing so they have to pay for that,' he added. The team are in line for some £28million of revenues from last season but would have forfeited the right to that if they had not turned up to compete in Australia with cars that satisfied the regulations. 'We knew we had the possibility of unknown problems and we haven't had the benefit of sorting some of those problems out in pre-season testing,' sporting director Graeme Lowdon said. 'But equally we had to come here on the basis that we're racing so we brought all of our normal equipment. There's 28 tonnes of equipment to support these cars and all of the staff. 'We are trying very hard but it is a tough thing to do in the time available.' VIDEO Hamilton cruises to victory in Australian GP .

    With their tiny pink noses, soft furry coats and sleepy eyes, these two clouded leopard cubs are simply adorable. The highly endangered kittens, which are both female, were born at Zoo Miami in Florida just three weeks ago, a treat for the facility's doting keepers.

Their birth is a victory in the fight to preserve a vulnerable species, which is not closely related to the African leopard. 'Both offspring are doing well and the mother continues to be attentive and nurse them on a regular basis,' the zoo told AP on Monday. Visitors should be able to view the kittens in the coming weeks. The clouded leopard, which is medium sized, lives in forests of South East Asia. In total, fewer than 10,000 are thought to exist in the wild.

    A couple are being forced to shut their upmarket fireplace shop because of the sound of noisy swingers upstairs. Matthew and Cheryl Jewell have had enough of 'embarrassing' noises coming from the sex club above their Stovestore business in Chorley, Lancashire. Despite their attempts to drown out the sounds, they claim customers are being driven away by the noises, which start around lunchtime. Matthew and Cheryl Jewell (pictured) claim it is 'embarrassing' when customers in their shop can hear screaming from upstairs . Mrs Jewell said: 'Customers are stood here and they're screaming upstairs. I'm going red, customers are going red and they're leaving the shop. 'We've spent thousands of pounds here and we're going to have to leave. We have so many customers that return to us here.' Despite their protestations, a representative of the No 3 swingers club, which has been open for two years, claims they are doing nothing wrong. No 3 Club owner, who said she only wanted to known as Mary, said she had suggested soundproofing, and had changed a day the club opened so it did not conflict with when the Stovestore was open. She said: 'I've done everything I possibly can. I don't want them to move. I don't think they like my type of business. They knew what it was before they moved in. 'I'm very disappointed and quite upset they're moving. I'll be sorry. I don't want to interfere with anybody else's business.' Problems began for Mr and Mrs Jewell when the No 3 Club expanded its opening hours into the working day, as well as its late night and early hours opening. 'It's more frequent now, they're open from 1pm onwards,' said Mrs Jewell. 'We were changing all our days for when they were noisiest. 'We know what's going on up there, but we can't do anything about it. Nobody can help.' The club website advertises the first Wednesday of every month as 'greedy girl day' beginning at midday . The Jewell's business The Stovestore (pictured) may be forced to close due to the noises from upstairs . The couple, who have owned the shop for two years, have complained to Chorley Council, but say their only option is to leave. Mrs Jewell added: 'We've made a couple of complaints, but there's no law for sexual activities. It's two years now just wasted.' According to the No 3 Club website, daytime activities include 'greedy girl day', which takes place on the first Wednesday of every month, between noon and 10pm. The two businesses share a landlord, Frank Patterson, who said he has asked No 3 Club to take steps improve the situation. Mr Patterson said: 'The No 3 Club came into the unit five years ago, Cheryl and Matthew have been there two years. There were two other tenants before them and it wasn't a problem. 'Now the No 3 Club has extended its hours into the working day. 'I've heard the noises and it's not acceptable. I've spoken to the No 3 Club about it on numerous occasions on behalf of Cheryl and Matthew and they've made no effort to improve the situation. If anything it's got worse.' He added: 'I've written to the No 3 Club and, if and when they renew their lease, I've told them there will be a restriction on them operating during the working day.' Councillor Paul Walmsley, from Chorley Council, said: 'The council has received a complaint about the No.3 Club, but as both parties are commercial premises, we do not have the powers to enforce nuisance proceedings. 'We will, however, continue to ensure they are compliant with their licence agreement as we would do with any other premises.'

    Robert Durst's wife has not spoken to him since explosive documentary, The Jinx, aired and is now living with his lawyer, it has been revealed. In the aftermath of the   documentary, which outlined the life of real estate scion Robert Durst and his possible involvement in multiple murders, many wished to know more about his wife of 15 years, Debrah Lee Charatan. Charatan, a self-made real estate executive, was briefly featured in the documentary in a clip from years earlier as she gave testimony to police pertaining to the her husband's murder of Morris Black in Galveston, Texas, but other than that did not participate in the film. Now it has been revealed that Charatan not only advised Durst against participating in the documentary, but also has not spoken to him since it premiered and has been living with his lawyer. This as the final episode featured audio of Durst possibly admitting to committing these murders, saying he 'killed them all' during a moment when the cameras were off but his microphone was still on. Scroll down for videos . Robert Durst's wife Debrah Lee Charatan is reportedly no longer supporting the millionaire real estate scion and has been living with his lawyer, Steven I. Holm (above) Durst (above) is expected to be charged with first-degree murder in the death of his friend Susan Berman, who was killed on Christmas Eve 2000 . The New York Times writes that Charatan seems to have taken a step back from her husband recently, no longer travelling with him and living with Steven I. Holm, one of his lawyers. Charatan and Holm were even photographed together at a Central Park event in 2010, though the extent of their relationship is not known and Charatan refused requests for comment from the paper. Authorities are now looking to question Charatan as they believe her husband is responsible for murdering his friend Susan Berman on Christmas Eve of 2000, just two weeks after he wed Charatan. The incident occurred shortly after Berman, a lifelong confidant of Durst, contacted the man to let him know that police wished to speak with her regarding the disappearance of his first wife Kathie in 1982, who to this day has never been found. Many believe Durst also knows about the disappearance of his first wife Kathie (above) who was last seen in 1982 . Both Durst and Charatan have previously revealed that they were only married so that she could receive his estate and inheritance should he die, and so the money would not go back into the family business. Durst remained upset that his father Seymour had selected his younger brother Douglas to run the Durst Organization in 1994, and thus did not want the $2million he received every year from a trust to go to the company should he die. 'It was our understanding that unless I was married to him, I couldn’t benefit from any of the trusts,' Charatan said in a deposition while being questioned about the Black incident, in which her husband was ultimately found by a jury to be acting in self defense when he shot the man and then dismembered his body. Because of their marriage however, Charatan cannot be compelled to testify against her husband as he faces possible new charges in the death of Berman, and even if she did, Durst would likely have her testimony blocked. Charatan, who wed Durst (above in his booking photo following his arrest for the Morris Black murder) in 2000, is said to have advised Durst against doing the recent documentary The Jinx . Meanwhile, reports that Charatan could also face aiding and abetting charges stemming from Durst's recent arrest in New Orleans as authorities believe he was trying to flee the country for Cuba, seem to be unfounded as she not only was not speaking to to him at that time but also was not responsible for sending him the $117,000 in cash that arrived shortly after he was taken into police custody on a warrant from Los Angeles County who wished to extradite him and charge him with murder in the death of Berman. That money it seems came from another woman in New York, who sent it to Durst in luggage that was also filled with shoes after he called her upon his arrival in New Orleans. Charatan has never said much about her husband, frequently refusing to comment about the man who she met at a real estate dinner in 1988, and has kept a very low profile in recent weeks as new charges have been brought against him. In addition to the murder charge in California, he also faces charges in New Orleans as he had a gun and sizable amount of marijuana on him at the time of his arrest. When Durst was arrested for murdering Black however, Charatan was the first person he called; handling his money, helping him decide what lawyer to hire and frequently flying to Texas for the trial. And while much has been made of Durst's tragic childhood and his mother's death by suicide when he was just a young boy, Charatan had an equally troubling youth. Her parents both came from Poland having survived the Nazis, her father losing his foot in a landmine explosion and her mother, an orphan, having been taken in and hidden by a Christian family. Charatan worked hard to make herself a success, once noting; 'I knew if I couldn’t be a star, I wouldn’t be happy.' Along the way she made many friends, and more than a few foes, in the industry. Both Durst (above) and Charatan admit that they only wed so she could eventually receive Durst's inheritance, though she also now cannot testify against him in court . Durst was said to be drawn to the fact that she had worked her way up in the male dominated industry, and helped her out financially as she went through a difficult divorce and custody hearing as well as numerous lawsuits from agents who claimed they had not received their promised commission from Charatan. She remains involved in real estate now, having recently taken her $20million share of Durst's $65million settlement from his claims against his family trust, to start a new company with her son, who she reconnected with roughly 10 years ago after not having spoken to the boy for 15 years. They have an investment office in the Union Square section of Manhattan, and Charatan also recently sold the Fifth Avenue apartment Durst helped her to buy in 1997 and the Bridgehampton home the two shared. Durst meanwhile is being held in a psychiatric correctional center outside New Orleans.

    As the part-time players of managerless Alloa Athletic punched the air in celebration of their latest point against Rangers, the scale of the job facing Stuart McCall veered into sharp focus. Frankly, the new Ibrox boss faces the biggest uphill task since Sir Edmund Hillary conquered Everest if he is to succeed in getting this bunch of players back to the summit league of Scottish football. On a night when Alloa left their shock new signing — ex-Sunderland and Newcastle striker Michael Chopra — on the bench until the dying embers of the match, a glancing header by former Chelsea kid Ben Gordon opened the scoring and had Rangers on the back foot. Rangers' Lee Wallace and Alloa's Jonathan Tiffoney tussle for the ball during the match at Ibrox . Rangers forward Dean Shiels challenges Alloa's Kevin Crawley during the Scottish Championship game . Alloa's new signing, former Sunderland and Newcastle striker Michael Chopra, made his debut at Irbox . Two goals from Nicky Clark in five minutes looked like somehow securing a rare victory for a stodgy and lethargic Rangers but Liam Buchanan’s late leveller ensured deserved parity for the team from the Wee County. It was merely the latest sting from the Wasps, who have now drawn twice at Ibrox in the league this season, as well as holding Rangers at home in the Championship and knocking them out of the Petrofac Training Cup in Clackmannanshire. For Ibrox fans, the elation of Dave King’s boardroom coup has very much been replaced by the utter deflation that comes as standard when watching this side. Indeed, when McCall’s team travels to Easter Road on Sunday hoping to keep their play-off hopes alive, the second-most expensively assembled squad in the country can be said to pitch up in Leith in the grip of relegation-esque form. Over the course of the last nine games — a quarter of a league season — third-placed Rangers have dropped 19 points from an available 27. In context, they have picked up eight points, while second-bottom Alloa and rock-bottom Livingston — who drew at Ibrox on Saturday — both have amassed six over the same time period. Rangers' Nicky Law gives chase to Alloa's Mark Docherty during the Scottish Championship match at Ibrox . And, worryingly for McCall, not even five changes to his starting line-up could inject any badly-needed urgency into proceedings. There was a first-team recall for goalkeeper Cammy Bell, who was pulling on a Rangers jersey for the first time in seven months after recovering from a shoulder injury. That meant Lee Robinson was on the bench, with veteran keeper Steve Simonson dropping out of the squad altogether. Injuries meant Rangers were without defender Sebastian Faure and attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, who has been one of the Ibrox club’s best players since arriving on loan from Newcastle United. Striker Kenny Miller dropped to the bench, while Kyle Hutton found himself left out of the squad completely. But the team news that stood out was Chopra, who took his place on the bench and would remain there for most of the evening. Rangers' Andy Murdoch and Alloa's Kevin Crawley both raise their feet for the ball during the 2-2 draw . In front of a crowd of 28,902, the first chance fell to Rangers. Lee Wallace raced down the left and his cross found its way to Clark, who turned and shot over the bar. Then captain Lee McCulloch seized on a corner and, when his first effort was blocked, his subsequent shot went out for a throw-in. The grumbles from the Ibrox stands began on 12 minutes. With each passing minute they grew louder. But young Tom Walsh gave them something to get excited about when he picked up a pass from Dean Shiels and sent a 20-yarder narrowly over the top of Craig McDowall’s crossbar. Kris Boyd then had a chance after good work down the left from Shiels. But his turn and shot ended with the ball being fired straight down McDowall’s throat. Young Andrew Murdoch then had a firm shot saved easily by McDowall. In the best move of the match, Walsh powered down the right and slipped a clever ball into the overlapping Wallace, but the full-back’s ball across goal was turned over his own bar by Michael Doyle. On a rare foray up the park, Kevin Cawley sent a weak right-foot shot from distance scampering wide of Bell’s goal. It had been a listless first half and the jeers at half-time were from fans who sounded wearily accustomed to this type of fare. Alloa defender Ben Gordon opens the scoring at Ibrox with a header past goalkeeper Cammy Bell . Gordon is congratulated by his team-mates after his goal gives the part-timers a shock lead at Ibrox . Rangers striker Nicky Clark equalised for the home side with a header of his own on 72 minutes . He then added a second five minutes later to give Rangers the lead against Alloa on Tuesday night . Clark celebrates his second goal Alloa player look frustrated with themselves for conceding . Despite Clark's brace, Rangers go on to draw 2-2 and interim boss Stuart McCall knows the scale of his job . There were more jeers at the start of the second half when the Ibrox support were beseeching their side to show some attacking urgency, only for Darren McGregor to take the safe option of a back-pass from the halfway line to keeper Bell. Worse was to follow when Alloa scored with their first meaningful effort on goal. Michael Docherty’s free-kick was glanced home by Gordon as Ibrox was left stunned, but not surprised. ‘Cancel their day off this week anaw Stuart,’ shouted a furious lone voice at the back of the Bill Struth Main Stand. Rangers nearly levelled with a header from Marius Zalkiukas but McDowall was equal to it as he pulled off a diving save. McCall’s side got back into it, however, when McCulloch’s deflected shot hit the bar and Clark cleverly diverted the ball with his head into the bottom corner past the stranded McDowall. Clark then thought he had won the match when he headed in a fine cross from the left by substitute David Templeton. Buchanan’s intervention in the 82nd minute, when he superbly chipped the ball over Bell and into the net, put paid to that idea. Buchanan was replaced by Chopra in the 95th minute but there was no time for the journeyman, who has cost £9.5million in transfer fees over the course of his troubled career, to become a hero. But, as the Alloa players milked their standing ovation from their hardy bunch of fans, the jeers and shouts of ‘disgrace’ that greeted the Rangers players at the final whistle left everyone in no doubt who, once again, were the villains of the piece. Rangers players look dejected after the final whistle as their hopes of promotion continue to fade away .
Summary target: 
    Rangers were held to a draw by part-time players of Alloa Athletic at Ibrox .
Ben Gordon gave Alloa the lead before Nicky Clark equalised .
Clark then grabbed a second goal to put Rangers in front .
However, Liam Buchanan managed to pull the visitors level late on .
New Alloa signing Michael Chopra was only afforded a cameo appearance .
Summarized text: 
    Rangers drew 1-1 with Alloa Athletic in the Scottish Championship. Ben Gordon scored twice for the Wasps before Liam Buchann levelled if Ranger were to go through at Ibrox - and win it. Stuart McCall'll be without his new signing, Michael Chopra, on Sunday despite making first appearance since joining the club he played under!

    A decorated British Army officer who devoted his retirement to helping troops serving on the frontline shot himself after allegedly feeling ‘harassed’ by a former aide to Margaret Thatcher, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Brigadier David Martin, 57, ended his life after receiving phone calls and a ‘harassing voicemail’ over a £300,000 dispute involving his military charity. Brig Martin was a director and trustee of UK4U Thanks, a charity founded in 2005 which works with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to deliver Christmas food parcels to troops in war zones. Diane Martin - pictured with son Will, centre, and her late husband David - says the Brigadier felt he would be ‘the sacrificial lamb’ in a row between UK4U and a businessman who PR man Hugh Colver was representing . In a letter to friends and family breaking the news, his widow said the brigadier was left agitated after speaking to PR man Hugh Colver earlier this month, saying he felt he would be ‘the sacrificial lamb’ in a row between UK4U and a businessman who Mr Colver was representing. In the letter, which was distributed on social media, devastated Diane Martin, 55, said: ‘David received an email on Sunday evening [March 1] which made him very agitated, and in his letter to me he said that the final straw was a harassing voicemail during the day from the same man. ‘It all concerned the UK4U Christmas box charity for which he was the chairman of trustees. The founding businessman felt that he had never been properly recompensed for his initial (very substantial) outlay – despite formal arbitration and subsequent revisiting of the arbitration by legal teams. ‘A high-powered PR man started to harass David for some sort of out-of-court settlement. Neither the charity nor the MoD could legally ‘pay off’ a claim that was unsubstantiated, so he concluded (again in his letter) that he would be the sacrificial lamb that would have to be found ‘guilty’ in order that the claims could be settled. ‘Everyone knew that he would have done nothing wrong but he felt powerless to challenge the allegations and didn’t have the resilience or energy to go through such a potentially traumatic period.’ Just hours after speaking to Mr Colver, a former director of communications for the Conservative Party, Brig Martin wrote a suicide note and killed himself in the grounds of his Cotswolds family home near Avening in Gloucestershire. 'Brought in to mediate': Hugh Colver said he was 'deeply saddened' by Brig Martin's death . When questioned by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Colver confirmed he had attempted to persuade Brig Martin to negotiate with businessman Stephen Briggs, who in 2005 provided UK4U with hundreds of thousands of pounds of start-up cash. When the charity’s trustees refused to pay back Mr Briggs from UK4U funds, he started legal action. According to the charity’s 2008 annual report, an arbitrator found the businessman was owed funds. The report adds that UK4U accepted the award but that Mr Brigg’s company ‘claimed further amounts’. Mr Colver, from Westbury, Wiltshire, said: ‘As far as I know Brigadier Martin and I did not know each other previously but he was aware of who I was and my background. I was brought in to mediate. ‘Our conversations were very reasonable and I got the impression he felt I was genuinely trying to help. He even thanked me for my efforts. He was surprised that the issues were still around, he thought it was all sorted by the arbitration and I said, well, unfortunately, it remains a dispute. The way the conclusion was arrived at is regarded, by some people, as invalid. The dispute is over several hundred thousand pounds and is very complicated.’ A friend of Brig Martin claimed that Mr Colver adopted an ‘icy tone’ in their conversations, but the PR man insisted: ‘I absolutely refute any suggestion that I was threatening and I was deeply saddened to learn of his death, this is tragic, ghastly.’ When approached by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Briggs said: ‘It is a very difficult situation and we are very saddened by the news. Hugh Colver is our mediator and he knows the true side of the story and I would listen very carefully to him.’ Brig Martin was made a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) during a glittering military career. His funeral was held yesterday. For confidential support, contact the Samaritans on 08457 909090 (the helpline is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year) or visit the website.

    Jose Mourinho's son has labelled Chelsea fans a 'disgrace' and the 'worst [he's] ever seen' after they booed Cesc Fabregas during Sunday's 1-1 draw with Southampton. Jose Mario, 15, a goalkeeper at Fulham, defended the Spanish midfielder and insisted he did not deserve to be singled out for criticism.

But Jose Mario, who is regularly seen at Stamford Bridge supporting the team and celebrated on the Wembley pitch with players after Chelsea won the Capital One Cup earlier this month, wrote on Instagram: 'Why is everyone hating and blaming Fabregas for Sunday's performance… It was a team effort. 'Fabregas might have not played as well as most expected but at least he kept fighting… Showed a lot of character, I've seen bad Chelsea fans but Sunday was the worse I've ever seen, Fans booing Cesc not singing at all, I completely agree with the chant 'Mourinho's right, you're fans are s****' 'Our fans are a disgrace!!!!'

    A late Lukas Podolski strike from an Andre Schurrle cross saved Germany from back-to-back home defeats by Australia at the Fritz-Walter-Stadion in Kaiserslautern. Podolski rescued the World Cup champions nine minutes from time with his 48th goal for his country as he combined with his fellow substitute and former Premier League outcast. The Socceroos' last visit to Germany in 2011 ended in a 2-1 shock loss for the hosts in Monchengladbach and it looked to be going that way again for much of the second half when captain Mile Jedinak gave his side the lead with a sensational curling free-kick. Lukas Podolski celebrates scoring the 81st-minute equaliser for Germany against Australia . Podolski got on the end of a cross from fellow substitute Andre Schurrle to level things up .

Then, five minutes into the second half, Crystal Palace stalwart and Socceroos captain nailed a perfect curling free-kick that left German keeper Ron-Robert Zieler flailing and in the back of his own net with the ball. History was on the visitors' side at this stadium. It was here that Australia made history with their first goal and first win in a World Cup when they beat Japan 3-1 in 2006.

    Three weeks after the video footage taken on the Paris Metro which shamed Chelsea, an initiative is gathering support among fans to fight back against the racists who still attach themselves to the club. Paris Saint-Germain visit Stamford Bridge for the second leg of a Champions League tie which will be forever tarnished by those Chelsea supporters who refused to let Souleymane S board a train at Richelieu-Drouot station as they sang: 'We’re racist and that’s the way we like it'. Many Chelsea fans are keen to use the return fixture to send a collective message around the world, and have been inspired to produce flags, banners, posters and t-shirts to project the mood. The Paris Saint-Germain squad are put through their paces at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday evening . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho addresses the media ahead of their return clash against Paris Saint-Germain . There will be posters, banners and flags showcasing Chelsea's stance against racism at Stamford Bridge . There will be posters handed out, printed in both English and French which state: 'No Racism at the Bridge. That’s the way we like it.' There will be t-shirts carrying the slogan 'We Only See Blue' and there will be flag hanging from the Matthew Harding Stand bearing a message: 'Blues Against Racism'. Souleymane has declined an invitation from Chelsea to attend the game but it is as if bearing witness to his experience, like something from Apartheid South Africa lurking amid the glitz of the Champions League, flicked a switch in the minds of thousands. Rather than cringe and ignore the ever-diminishing faction of racists who have lingered around Chelsea since the 1980s – and other clubs, it must be said - supporters are getting active at ground-level with campaigns which has the potential to be more powerful than all those well-intentioned messages from the top of society. Souleymane S has declined an invitation from Chelsea to attend Wednesday night's Champions League tie . Five of the Chelsea fans involved in the disgraceful incident have been suspended from attending matches . Since the Metro footage went viral, another two incidents of racist abuse involving Chelsea-associated yobs singing on trains have been reported to police and are being investigated. Ben Price, a 37-year-old gardener and Chelsea supporter since the early nineties, set up a Facebook page which he found gathered rapid support at home and abroad. Paul Canoville, the club’s first black player, was quick to back the movement, as was Richard West, aka Mr C, the DJ and former frontman for the Shamen, who is a Chelsea fan. Price was responsible for the 'No Racism at the Bridge' posters on show during the Burnley game, last month, and will be outside the Shed End, handing out more before the game against PSG. 'It’s a message that says that collectively we do not tolerate racism and we cannot be branded a racist club,' said Price. 'It’s a message for Souleymane S and for other clubs and their fans and for football’s authorities like UEFA and FIFA and hopefully we can send it around the world, because the eyes of the world will be on us.'

    Around 200 mysterious stone structures have mystified experts since they were discovered in the Gobi Desert in 2003. Known as the ‘strange stone circles’ by locals in Turpan, the formations vary in size and shape with one intricate example resembling the sun. And now an expert has suggested they could have been used by primitive nomads to worship the sun, and may have even been a site where sacrifices were made - although the types of sacrifices is not known. Scroll down for video . Around 200 mysterious stone circles have mystified experts since they were discovered in the Gobi Desert in 2003. The largest structure in this image is known as the sun circle. An expert has suggested they could have been used by nomads to worship the sun, and may have even been a site where sacrifices were made . There are similarities between the Chinese stones and Stonehenge in Wiltshire. This includes the formations being linked with sun worshippers, the shape of the structures including so-called 'exits', and the fact the stones were transported to the site from outside the region. The circles are located in the Flaming Mountain in Turpan, north west China and cover more than two-and-a-half square miles (6.6 square km). They have been filmed from above using a drone by a local tourism association, in an attempt to further understand the structures and their origins, People’s Daily Online reported. Experts said that the stone circles are in line with local historical traditions but very little is known about them, including their age. Some people had assumed that they were burial sites and attempted to dig them up. The mysterious collection of circles and squares have been filmed from above using a drone by a local tourism association, in an attempt to further understand the structures and their origins. A aerial shot is shown. If they were used as sacrificial sites, the type of sacrifices is not known . The circles are located in the Flaming Mountain in Turpan, north west China, a matter of miles from Lianmuqin town (marked) and cover more than two-and-a-half square miles (6.6 square km) Similar formations were found in Burkhan Khaldun mountain in north Mongolia and archaeologists have even suggested these Mongolian rocks could help pinpoint the location of Genghis Khan's tomb. This view is shared by Dr Volker Heyd, an archaeologist at the University of Bristol. He told MailOnline: 'First of all, they are man-made; there is no doubt about it. 'I have seen similar features in neighbouring Mongolia where they are well known too [and] they are regarded as ritual features. One particular stone circle is known as the ‘Sun Circle’ (pictured) and is formed by four concentric circles, the largest of which measures 26 ft (eight metres) in diameter, with the smallest inner ring destroyed . The stone structures are built on high points of the land and some are square, with ‘exits’ to combine certain shapes (pictured). A lack of evidence of bodies at the sites has led one expert to rule out that the formations are burial sites, instead claiming they were sacrificial worship sites for ancient nomadic people . No-one is sure what the mysterious stone 'walls' were used for. Some people thought they may be ancient burial sites, but no bodies have been found nearby and the soil beneath the circles and squares is said to be undisturbed. The largest of the shapes, which features four concentric circles may have been the focus of sacrifices to a sun god. Dr Volker Heyd, an archaeologist at the University of Bristol said its likely the structures are burial sites. But a local unnamed expert believes they were used for making sacrifices to the sun god thousands of years ago. There is no precise date for the structure, but Dr Heyd added the first of these Gobi stone structures might date back as early as the Bronze Age. Although the more complex formations are likely 'younger and could have been constructed until the Medieval period.' 'Some might have served as surface marking of burial places. At least in Mongolia, excavations have occasionally found graves in the centre of such features. 'Others, if not the majority might denote holy places in the landscape, or places with special spiritual properties, or ritual offering/meeting places.' He continued that the first of these Gobi stone structures might date back as early as the Bronze Age. This could make them up to 4,500 years old. Although the more complex formations are likely 'younger and could have been constructed until the Medieval period.' However, a local specialist told Yahoo this is unlikely because the soil beneath them is undisturbed. The stone formations are built on high points of the land and some are square, with ‘exits’. One particular stone circle is known as the ‘Sun Circle’ and is formed by four concentric circles - the largest of which measures 26 ft (eight metres) in diameter, with the smallest inner ring destroyed. On the southeast of the Sun Circle there are a multiple circles of different sizes. Because of the shape of this particular circle, and a lack of evidence of bodies at the sites, the unnamed local expert told Yahoo the circles were likely to have been sacrificial worship sites for ancient nomadic people - although he didn’t elaborate on what may have been sacrificed. The stone circles have been compared to Stonehenge in Wiltshire (pictured), whose origins and purpose remains largely a mystery, with some experts suggesting it too was used to worship the sun . The rocks used in the structures in China (pictured) are not from the desert where the circles are located, suggesting that they were brought from afar, much like Stonehenge’s famous bluestones . 'Across central Asia these circles are usually sacrificial sites,’ he said. ‘We can image that this was a site for worshipping the god of the sun.' He explained that the circles are all located on higher ground, which fits the selection conditions for ancient worship ceremonies. The stone circles may be compared to Stonehenge in Wiltshire, whose origins and purpose remains largely a mystery, with some experts suggesting it too was used to worship the sun. Scattered across Jordan are 12 giant circular structures that can only be fully seen using aerial and satellite images. Known collectively as the Big Circles, the vast rings - which range from between 720ft and 1,490ft (220 metres to 455 metres) in diameter - were first spotted from the air in the 1920s, and surveys in 1930, 1953 and 2002 have since revealed more details about their size, shape and locations. Archaeologists from Western Australia have documented 12 of them to try and learn more about their purpose. A total of eight big circles have been recorded in west central Jordan, between the Wadi el-Hasa and the edge of the Shara escarpment. There is also a second group, made of four Big Circles, just north of Azraq Oasis. Pictured is circle J1, known locally as Qasr Abu el-Inaya. It is located 2.4 miles (4km) west of the Hedjaz Railway and Desert Highway . There are eight Big Circles in west central Jordan, a second group, made of four Big Circles just north of Azraq Oasis. Plus, a more recent Big Circle spotted in 2002 near Homs in Syria. Like the mysterious structures in China, their construction is simple and typically consists of low walls of uncut boulders. However, they are incredibly precise and because they are so large, would have involved teams of workers. Professor David Kennedy from the university, said an ‘architect’ would have plotted the circles using rope tied to a post in the centre . ‘Some show signs of greater care with stones at least roughly shaped and laid in courses’ he added. Dating is also said to be problematic, but there is often material in or around the circles that originated in the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age (between 2,000 to 4,500BC). A number of the circles contain later material, typically dating to the Roman period between 1st and 7th century BC. In another parallel, the rocks at the site in China are not from the desert where the circles are located, suggesting that they were brought from afar, just like Stonehenge’s famous bluestones. The sun circle itself is made from over 200 of these mysterious stones. Although not identical, due to their much more complex design, geoglyphs in Peru have equally baffled experts about the practices of ancient groups. More commonly known as the Nazca Lines, they were first spotted in 1939 when a pilot flew over the Nasca planes of the Peruvian coastal highlands. They were designated as a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1994 and the area stretches more than 50 miles (80km) between the towns of Nazca and Palpa, about 400 km south of Lima. Experts have said that the stone circles (pictured) are in line with local historical traditions, but very little is known about them, including their age . The circles and squares (pictured) are all located on higher ground, which fits the selection conditions for ancient worship ceremonies . Contrary to the popular belief that the figures can only be seen from the air, they are actually visible from the surrounding foothills. Paul Kosok, from Long Island University, is credited as the first scholar to seriously study the Nazca Lines. He discovered that the lines converged at the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere. Along with Maria Reiche, a German mathematician and archaeologist, Kosok proposed the figures were markers on the horizon to show where the sun and other celestial bodies rose. Although not identical, due to their much more complex design, geoglyphs in Peru have equally baffled experts about the practices of ancient groups. More commonly known as the Nazca Lines (pictured), they were first spotted in 1939 when a pilot flew over the Nasca planes of the Peruvian coastal highlands . The Nazca Lines were designated as a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1994 and the area stretches more than 50 miles (80km) between the towns of Nazca and Palpa, about 400 km south of Lima. Paul Kosok, from Long Island University said that the lines converged at the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere .

    Around 200 mysterious stone circles have mystified experts since they were discovered in Turpan, north west China. They are known as the ‘stony stones’ and vary in size and shape with one instance resembling the sun - although no specific sacrifice is made there if it were used as a sacred site for worship 'the sun' Experts said that these structures are in line to local historical traditions but very little is know about them.

    Leeds did it under Don Revie; Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United side did it; Atletico Madrid under Diego Simeone do it. Many great sides have hounded and harassed referees over the years. It’s a characteristic at times of their determination to win and their unity. So when Chelsea surrounded referee Bjorn Kuipers to get Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off on Wednesday it wasn’t something new, or a modern phenomenon that has been creeping up on us. It has nothing to do with foreign players and managers coming into the game. It’s been a part of English football for years. Having said that, now is the time to draw a line and punish teams that overstep the mark in this way, as I believe Chelsea did on Wednesday and I think it could be done with a simple amendment to the rules. Almost all the Chelsea squad surrounded referee Bjorn Kuipers after an incident at Stamford Bridge . If a referee feels that he is being aggressively hounded by a group of players he should have the power to reverse the decision and award the free kick the other way. So on Wednesday night, he could still have sent off Ibrahimovic if he really felt it was a red card offence but Chelsea would have lost the advantage of a free kick. It wouldn’t immediately cut out hounding refs but it would be a nudge in the right direction. Behaviour only changes if managers are encouraged to discipline their players. At the moment, it’s worthwhile clamouring round a referee to get a decision, so few coaches would discourage their players from doing so. However, if you felt that by hounding the referee, your team might lose a potential goal-scoring opportunity, because you would miss out on a free kick on the edge of the box, managers would soon start telling their players to exercise more restraint. And over-zealous appealing for penalties would stop pretty quickly. Imagine losing the chance to take a penalty kick because you had surrounded the referee. The manager would be furious. Referees are only human. Kuipers might have looked at the Ibrahimovic tackle and thought it was a 50-50 decision. But when you have 38,000 people screaming for the red card and then you have a group of players around demanding it too, all of that activity around him might make him feel it’s a 90 per cent decision. This tackle from PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic sparked a furious reaction from Chelsea players . The Chelsea players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers at Stamford Bridge as he brandishes the red card . Chelsea captain John Terry (left) reacts after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar in the first-half . This would only be a small change in the rules but I believe it would make a massive change in behaviour over time. Certainly managers wouldn’t encourage their team to attempt to influence the referee in that way anymore because there would be an immediate punishment which could cost the team. It gives the referee a little bit more power and it would act as powerful disincentive. You could also apply the same rule of reversing the free kick if a player showed an imaginary card, trying to get an opponent booked or sent off. That would soon end what is an unsavoury practice. Another area which needs looking at is when a player marches towards a referee in an aggressive manner, forcing the referee to back off. It’s natural for players to complain when they feel aggrieved and when emotions are running high. But what is important is that we establish that exclusion zone around the referee where players won’t encroach. If someone is to complain, they can do so backing away from the referee, getting into position, not moving towards him. And if someone does need to go to referee, it should only be the captain. And when complaining they should show some respect for the personal space of the referee. John Terry (centre) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following Ibrahimovic's first-half challenge . Football is a physical game and that is part of its spectacle. I’ve no desire to curb the aggression of players when it’s directed in the right way. But referees need to be protected and their personal space needs to be almost sacrosanct. It’s important to draw a line and clearly state what is and isn’t acceptable. WHEN FRIDAY COMES, ENGLISH TEAMS CAN FEEL BENEFIT IN EUROPE . It has been an awful few weeks for English teams in Europe with only Everton thriving in the Europa League. Given the competitiveness of the Premier League you would imagine that our teams would be more than ready for this stage of the Champions League and Europa League, when the competitions step up a level. But the reverse seems to happening. The sheer competitiveness of the Premier League is leaving us short in these difficult games. Not only do we tend to have four teams who believe they can win the title, which is not the case in most of Europe’s other major leagues, but there is an increased level of intensity about all our games. Everton are progressing well in the Europa League as other English sides continue to struggle in Europe . Having played in France, I know that for Paris Saint-Germain, Marseille and Lyon there will only be a handful of games for which they need to be at their best. It’s not that it’s easy but going to the smaller French teams is not like going to Turf Moor to play Burnley or Loftus Road to play QPR, where the crowd is right on top of you and everyone is expecting the home side to put one over Chelsea or Manchester United. That’s not the case in France, and I’m not sure it is in Italy or Spain. Obviously Bayern Munich are utterly dominant in Germany at the moment, so there aren’t that many games where they need to be at the top level. Don’t forget that while our teams were playing five games in two weeks over Christmas, Bayern, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke were on a 40-day break. Arsenal endured a torrid Champions League 3-0 defeat against Monaco late last month . And while the Christmas break isn’t as long in France, Italy and Spain, it allows their players to relax get a couple of weeks in the sun. It’s ironic that the intensity and competitiveness of the Premier League, which is what has made it so successful, might now be damaging our performance in Europe and by extension damaging it’s reputation. However, there is an opportunity now to help English team in the Champions League. Jose Mourinho has long drawn attention to Spanish teams playing games on a Friday night if they have a Tuesday night Champions League game. The new £5.1billion TV deal — a mark of how popular the Premier League is — has provision for some Friday night games. The Premier League and TV companies should be looking at those Friday night games to see whether they can schedule teams competing in the Champions League. We need to give our teams every chance we can. After all, if Premier League clubs consistently fail in Europe, global audiences will begin to question just how good these clubs really are. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers' side crashed of the Europa League to Besiktas in late February . GREAT TO LOOK BACK AT MY CAREER . I was really honoured a few months ago when Sky Sports asked if I would be the subject of a documentary covering my life in football. The result will be shown tonight on Sky Sports 1 and it’s been a trip down memory lane for me and a chance to reflect on my career. There are one or two things I hadn’t remembered, like the post-match interview I did after scoring on my league debut as an 18-year-old against Stoke in 1976. The collars on the shirt I was wearing — oh my word! They look like something Barry White might have turned down as excessive. Glenn Hoddle volleys in for Tottenham against Manchester United in 1979, his favourite goal he scored . And I’m pleased to say my Top of the Pops appearance singing Diamond Lights gets an outing — not that any of the musicians will be. It also gave me a chance to take another look at my favourite goal, the volley I scored for Tottenham against Manchester United from just inside the box in 1979. I’ve never taken drugs in my life but the feeling I had that day, with the adrenalin pumping through my body after scoring, is how I imagine it feels. I hope people enjoy watching the film as much as I did making it. Glenn Hoddle: A Touch of Genius, Sky Sports 1, 7pm .

    David Beckham has thrown his backing behind under-pressure Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti ahead of a crucial El Clasico against Barcelona, listing the Italian coach as one of the best bosses he has played under. Real go into Sunday's showdown a point behind their fierce rivals from Catalonia, and talk has even surfaced that Ancelotti could lose his job should they fall further behind in the title race. A difficult year for the European champions saw them surrender the title lead to Barcelona and then struggle to make it through to the Champions League quarter-finals with a tight win over Schalke. David Beckham has thrown his backing behind under-pressure Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti . The Real boss goes into Sunday's El Clasico a point behind Barcelona and his position has been questioned . But despite their struggles, former Real midfielder Beckham believes Ancelotti remains the right man for the job after leading Los Blancos to their 10th Champions League win just 10 months ago. 'Is he the right man for the job? For me he is,' Beckham told AS. 'Because he knows how to get respect out of the players, he knows how to get the best out of the players – and the players respect him, as does everybody in the football world. Beckham labelled Ancelotti as one of the best managers he has worked under after their time at PSG . Ancelotti and Beckham had previously paired up during the England midfielder's loan spell with AC Milan . 'I love Carlo, he's one of the best people I've ever spent time with, one of the best managers I've ever been managed by. He's a manager who has humility, he has so much passion for the game, he's a winner, he's always been successful wherever he has gone and for me, he's not just one of the nicest people in the world but also one of the best managers I have ever played under. 'To see the success he has already had at Real Madrid for me is incredible and not surprising. I look at him as a person and as a manager – as a person, you can't get any better and as a manager, the same. He's one of the best.' Ancelotti lifts the European Cup at the end of last season, but Real have struggled to match expectations . Beckham's time at the Bernabeu ended with a La Liga title before he moved to play for LA Galaxy in America .

    Suzette Davenport said tougher sanctions are needed for those caught making calls, sending texts and checking emails while driving . DRIVERS who use mobile phones at the wheel should be banned from the roads, Britain’s top traffic officer said yesterday. Suzette Davenport insisted that a rise in offending showed much tougher punishments were needed to deter the worst culprits. But she claimed ministers were too scared of losing votes in May’s election to act against the estimated 500,000 motorists who break the law every day. The Gloucestershire chief constable said the absence of proper penalties risked making it socially acceptable to text or surf the internet while driving. The offence of using a hand-held mobile at the wheel currently attracts only a £100 fine with three penalty points. Miss Davenport said: ‘If someone is caught twice using a mobile phone within a period of time we should be considering things like disqualifications. ‘If we don’t do something fundamentally different we are going to have lost this. 'I have had those conversations with ministers. I would take a much harder line in terms of outcomes from enforcement. The minister doesn’t like my proposal.’ Asked why ministers had rejected her call, she told the BBC: ‘Probably timing’s not great. I don’t think it would be popular with lots of people. 'An election is not too far away so I’m sure they’re not likely to pick up and run with anything that they feel is not likely to be helpful to them in the next election.’ Miss Davenport, who speaks on road issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said drivers repeatedly glancing at their smartphones were effectively using a computer. Her intervention follows the release of figures last week showing that mobile offending has risen despite numerous crackdowns. Robert Goodwill, Tory transport minister, rejected the claim that he was blocking road safety reform for electoral reasons. Some 1.6 per cent of Britain's estimated 36million drivers were spotted using a handheld phone while at the wheel last year – up on 1.4 per cent for a similar exercise carried out five years earlier in 2009 . He insisted the Government was reviewing the introduction of a six-point penalty, two instances of which would trigger a ban. And he turned his fire on the police, saying chief constables were too quick to take the easy option of using speed cameras instead of deploying more traffic officers. ‘One of the reasons people do these things is because they think they can get away with it,’ he said. ‘It is important that police and crime commissioners and chief constables look at the resources they put into this as opposed to other more easy offences to detect like speeding where cameras can catch people on an industrial scale. ‘There is no point increasing the penalties if we are not actually catching people.’ Research shows that the distraction effect of using a mobile phone is worse than being over the limit on drink or drugs. But the penalties are far lower – unless motorists are convicted of careless or dangerous driving. And official figures show that the number of fixed penalty notices has fallen 26 per cent while offending – as observed in spot checks by transport officials – has risen 14 per cent since 2009. Edmund King of the AA said: ‘Basically we need more cops in cars to target the mobile phone abusers that we observe behind the wheel on most journeys. ‘Most drivers would welcome harsher penalties but we still need the perceived risk of being caught to increase before more drivers hang up behind the wheel.’ The row threatens to overshadow the introduction today of ‘drug driving’ laws. Drivers face prosecution if they are caught exceeding new limits which have, for the first time, been laid down for eight illegal drugs and eight prescription drugs. The levels for the illegal drugs, which include heroin, cocaine and cannabis, virtually mean there will be zero tolerance for drivers caught with these substances in their system. Police will be able to use ‘drugalysers’ to screen for cannabis and cocaine at the roadside. Officers will also be able to test for these and other drugs including ecstasy, LSD, ketamine and heroin at a police station, even if a driver passes the roadside check. Under the existing law it is illegal to use a phone while driving, even when stopped at traffic lights or queuing in traffic. If caught, a driver faces an automatic fixed penalty notice worth £100 and 3 penalty points on their licence. Only if it goes to court do they risk being disqualified, but the maximum fine is only £1,000. By comparison, drink-drivers face 6 months in jail, a fine of up to £5,000 fine and a driving ban for at least a year, rising to three years if convicted twice in a decade. The research revealed that using a handheld device is more distracting than alcohol or drugs, with drivers twice as likely to have their head down and eyes off the road while texting or using the internet. Some 1.6 per cent of Britain's estimated 36million drivers were spotted using a handheld phone while at the wheel last year – up on 1.4 per cent for a similar exercise carried out five years earlier in 2009. Two thirds of those observed breaking the law (1.1 per cent) last year had the phone in their hand rather than held to their ear – suggesting that they were using it to text or check the internet. The figures prompted Mr Clegg to call for tougher penalties. Speaking on his LBC radio phone-in, he said: 'I just don’t think we should beat about the bush here. It might seem like someone, “Oh I’m going to make a quick call home saying I’m doing to be late because I’m stuck in traffic". 'it is really dangerous. The evidence is overwhelming. You cannot call and devote the same attention as you should to keep yourself safe and others whilst driving a vehicle. 'That’s why in this government we’ve actually increased the penalty, we’ve dramatically increased the penalties, just I think a couple of years ago. 'I personally would be prepared to go further until we send out a clear and unambiguous message that this is dangerous and it should not be done.'
Summary target: 
    Suzette Davenport calls for prison terms for using a phone while driving .
Smartphones mean it is 'effectively using a computer on your lap'
Warns tougher sanctions would be unpopular with voters before election .
Tory roads minister Robert Goodwill denies claim election is to blame .
But Lib Dem Nick Clegg backs calls for new laws to send a 'clear message'
Summarized text: 
    Suzette Davenport said tougher penalties are needed to deterfenders. She claimed ministers were too scared of losing votes in May'S election - but they could have done more if they didn’t take action against the worst culprits a year ago – and not now!

    Mesut Ozil might have been in good form since returning from injury this season, but he still needs to be better if Arsenal are to challenge for the title, according to Gunners legend Gilberto Silva. The Brazilian, a member of the Gunners' Invincibles team, labelled the German 'slow' and says he has to be more decisive. Gilberto acknowledged Ozil's quality, but insists that he needs to start paying off the faith Arsene Wenger showed by spending £42.5m to bring him to the Emirates Stadium from Real Madrid. Mesut Ozil has not found things easy since moving to Arsenal, but has improved recently . Ozil has a shot deflected over the bar against Everton, and Gilberto Silva says he must offer more . 'You speak about Arsenal and how they don't spend big money on a player often but they did with (Mesut) Ozil and it is always a bit risky,' he said. 'Coming from Spain it is tough to adapt, it doesn't always happen straight away. 'I do really like him as a player but sometimes in the game he does look quite slow, although he has that quality to change the game. 'He can be more decisive for Arsenal for the quality he has, he can be much more decisive for the club. Arsenal have not won the Premier League in the 11 years since Gilberto and his team-mates went unbeaten, and the 38-year-old believes they still don't have the financial firepower to challege Chelsea and Manchester City. Gilberto was a key member of the Arsenal team that went an entire Premier League season unbeaten in 2004 . Arsenal have not won the title since their Invincible season, but Gilberto insists it is now time to challenge . But Gilberto also stressed that the club should be aiming for the title, and given time Arsene Wenger can lead his current squad to glory. 'Arsenal hasn't been able to compete with Chelsea and Manchester City for a few years because they spend money on big names and this is not the Arsenal culture', said Gilberto. 'They don't spend a lot of money to sign players but apart from that it is not easy to find a way to get back on track to win titles. Ozil is the Gunners record signing, but in general the club has not tried to compete with rich clubs financially . The German playmaker will need to improve if Arsenal are to mount a serious title challenge, says Gilberto . 'It was important for them last season that they won the FA Cup but a team like Arsenal need more and I hope they find a way to achieve what they always look for. 'If you look at Chelsea, they spent a lot of money on a player like Diego Costa and he has settled really well and is scoring lots of goals, that has worked for them but it is not as easy for Arsenal. 'If the players concentrate on their job and pull together they can form a strong team and try to feel good in their play. 'Sometimes people expect quick results but it doesn't always work like that.' Brazil v Chile is on March 29 at 3pm at the Emirates Stadium in London. Tickets are still available from £30 Adults/£15 Concessions at www.arsenal.com/tickets .

    Andre Johnson and college team-mate Frank Gore moved to Indianapolis to win a Super Bowl. After being released by the Texans, the 33-year-old wide receiver was left to ponder his next move. But both he and Gore - who left the 49ers - were settled on the same landing spot. 'After I got released by the Texans, Frank called me,' Johnson told NBC Sports. 'He called me right after it happened and was just like, "What are you gonna do?" I’m like, "Frank, I don’t know. I just got released. I don’t know." 'I asked, him "Who do you think has the best chance to win a Super Bowl?" And he was like, "Indy." And I was like, "That’s my same choice too so let’s do it, let’s go for it." And they were able to get both of us here.' Andre Johnson leaves the Texans after 12 seasons with the franchise and has his sights set on a Super Bowl . The rampaging Frank Gore gives Indianapolis a bulldozing, reliable running back . According to ESPN, Johnson's deal is worth $21million over three years. Drafted third overall in 2003, Johnson goes down as the greatest player in the expansion franchise's history. He caught 1,012 passes on 1,599 targets for 13,597 yards and averages 6.0 receptions per game, an NFL record. And for the first time in his career, the seven-time Pro Bowler has the chance to play with a quarterback of elite quality in Andrew Luck. 'That was a very big part of it, wanting to be in a place with a stable quarterback,' he said. 'Andrew is arguably the best quarterback in the game.' After reaching the AFC Championship last time out, the addition of former Miami Hurricanes team-mate Gore gives Indianapolis the chance to bookend the Trent Richardson experiment. At 31, Gore is past his prime, but adds a bulldozing element to the backfield after signing a three-year, $12m deal.
Summary target: 
    Johnson joins with the intention of winning a championship .
Playing with Andrew Luck was a large factor in his decision .
Gore has posted four straight 1,000-yard rushing seasons .
The Colts haven't had a player rush for 100 yards in a game since 2012 .

    Your very own home to buy for less than $200,000, a short drive from Sydney's CBD - no, this is not a real estate fairytale. SQM Research guru Louis Christopher has poured over the current listings and singled out his top 10 in Sydney and Paul Bird from the Real Estate Institute of Victoria, has done the same for Melbourne buyers. If you think you've been priced out of the Sydney or Melbourne property markets, you're wrong, according to these real estate experts, who have found hidden gems among the over-inflated prices. 'The Sydney market is now 25 per cent above fair valuation but there is bargain buying,' Mr Christopher admitted. One of his top picks came in under $200,000 and where he found the others will surprise. Less than $200,000. The cheapest on the market and top pick, just 45 kilometres west of the CBD, a one-bed, one bathroom unit in St Marys is listed at $199,950 in the over-inflated Sydney property market . St Marys unit described as 'a low buy in price, all studios have been renovated to a high standard, close to train station and shopping centre with excellent growth prospects for the area' This St Marys apartment is going for less than half the median price for units in the western suburb of Sydney . There are listings in the eastern suburbs and inner west which make his top ten. And while there is no Toorak or Malvern in the Melbourne cheapies, they are still close to the Victorian capital and won't stretch the budget much beyond $300,000. Globally, Sydney is considered the third most expensive property market behind only Hong Kong and Vancouver, when it comes to housing versus household income - and Melbourne fares little better, ranking sixth. But there are ways around the rankings. 1 Werribee $240,000 . 2. Hoppers Crossing $299,999 . 3. Carrum Downs $329,000 . 4. Wyndham Vale $352,500 . 5. Hampton Park $360,000 . 6. Deer Park $363,500 . 7. Truganina $370,000 . 8. Pakenham $375,000 . 9. Frankston $375,000 . 10. Craigieburn $378,500 . 1. St Marys  $199,950 . 2. Waterloo $380,000 . 3. Cronulla $400,000 . 4. Wiley Park $419,000 . 5. Potts Point $429,000 . 6. Kingswood $440,000 . 7. Casula $470,000 . 8. Gladesville $485,000 . 9. Dharruk $490,000 . 10. Ingleburn $490,000 . The Potter Street apartment enjoys open plan kitchen equipped with premium appliances, flowing to private garden side balcony, a built-in robe and ducted air conditioning and access to a swimming pool, spa, sauna and gym . Room with a view in Waterloo. Just four kilometres south of the CBD, this studio apartment is considered a perfect entry point for the first home buyer and the astute investor - just $380,000 . 'Suburbs just like St Marys are increasingly in demand because of their affordability, the importance of the future second airport and infrastructure plans,' Louis Christopher said. The property on the Great Western Highway is going for just $199,950. 'Now this is a basic entry level but you must remember that St Marys has, on our numbers, risen 41 per cent in the past 3 years for units,' he added. 'And the median for units there is $391,000 - this is almost half that.' Werribee home for just $240,000, south-west of Melbourne. Comes in well below the median price for the area and is among the top pick for bargain buys in Victoria according to real estate experts . For your $240,000 you'll get a 'freshly painted home boasting three spacious bedrooms with large built in robes and main bathroom with separate shower and bath' Like St Marys, top of the Melbourne list is found a similar distance from the CBD, at Werribee south-west of the capital. For about $240,000, a 3 bedroom brick home can be all yours. 'Werribee, Hoppers Crossing and Carrum Downs are Melbourne’s most affordable suburbs,' said Paul Bird from the Real Estate Institute of Victoria. Also under the $300,000 mark is the three-bedder at Hoppers Crossing, also south-west of the city. The 46 Hampstead Drive home is on a 580 square metre property and boasts two bathrooms, split system reverse cycle unit and ceiling fans throughout, as well as floating flooring and a new pergola. 'Capital growth will still be at the top end of our forecast this year of between 8 to 12 per cent for Sydney,' Mr Christopher said. 'Right now no triggers are there on the horizon to stop it.' 'The Waterloo property is an interesting one. 'That's a unit in an area where the median is at $736,000, so to get it for $380,000 is an eye-opener. Potts Point apartment going for $429,000. Agents say it is 'reminiscent of a chic Parisian studio, the 33msq apartment is tucked away in a leafy cul-de-sac enclave in Potts Point’s fashionable Macleay Street quarter' It has black Japan floors, chandeliers• and is less than 2 kilometres to the CBD and offered for sale furnished . The one-bedder also comes with a 'common roof-top with harbour views' 'Potts Point has a median of $582,000 and is full of 1 bedders and studios and then you go to $1.17 million for two bedroom apartments.' He has found a small apartment on Crick Avenue for $429,000 and a property at Cronulla, not far from southern beaches for just $400,000. 'Buyers have to make sure, that even with these bargains, they need to do the work, inspections are recommended, you must check the quality always, yes it could be cheap but you need to know what you are getting for your money.' But he left, perhaps his best, for last. 'I like the one in Dharruk, a standard house, under $500,000 for what is basically 3 bedder on 600 square metres,' he said. 'It's not a mansion but look that's really affordable real estate, that means for your first home buyer they are keeping their mortgage low . 'Basically with a 10 per cent deposit, you're keeping your mortgage under 450-thousand. 'You are getting house and land which you can build up. 'Some people may turn their noses up now but in time that will change, especially with the plans for the second Sydney Airport.' Not to be outdone, Victorian suburbs are still providing value in the over-inflated market. 'They (Werribee and Hoppers Crossing) have median house prices below $350,000, while Wyndham Vale, Hampton Park and Deer Park are close behind.' $299,000 at Hoppers Crossing for three bedrooms, double garage at rear, split system reverse cycle unit and ceiling fans throughout plus solar panels, new pergola and timber decking . The Hoppers Crossing buy boasts a 'good sized living area' on a block of about 580msq . He singled out them out for areas with median house prices below $365,000, while Truganina, Pakenham, Frankston and Craigieburn round out Melbourne’s list of most affordable suburbs with average house prices below $380,000. The number of Australian residential property listings was steady in the past month, Sydney reporting a jump in listings as more vendors placed their houses on the market, looking to make a sale after the summer beak, while some buyers backed away due to the high prices. 'The key point that Sydney right now is that it has less listings on the market than Perth does, it's crazy considering the population base of both. 'Stock is getting absorbed very quickly, it's such a bull market, and property is taken out real quick.' A two-bedroom apartment in the inner western suburb of Sydney, Gladesville, under $500,000 . They call the Gladesville apartment, which is among Louis Cristopher's Top 10 bargain buys in Sydney as a 'well presented two bedroom unit with a sunny north-east aspect, featuring a modern kitchen with stainless steel appliances and a breakfast bar' He said from his company's viewpoint, listings were 'at a record low point for past 10 years'. 'Over in Perth they cannot sell a thing, the market is falling away badly, the fly-in fly-out market is gone and that is causing a big rise in rental supply. 'I's different on the retail front because of the mining boom, retail rents went through the roof, they locked themselves in for five year leases and can't get it down, so prices stay high.' Nationally, the number of unsold properties reached 351,843 last month, a modest rise and 1.6 per cent up from a year earlier. 283 Ballarto Road at Carrum Downs, negotiations welcome at $329,000 for the 3-bedder . 'Werribee, Hoppers Crossing and Carrum Downs are Melbourne’s most affordable suburbs,' said Paul Bird from the Real Estate Institute of Victoria . 'Overall there is no national housing bubble forming, except for Sydney and parts of Melbourne,' warned Louis Cristopher from SQM Research . Managing Director of SQM Research, Louis Christopher, said lower interest rates should continue to drive the Sydney market and lift buyer demand elsewhere . Low interest rates will help to underpin investor demand for property, helping vendors to sell their properties, which will keep a lid on listings in those cities, Mr Christopher said. SQM Research is an independent property research house which specialises in providing accurate property related research and data to financial institutions, property professional, real estate investors and the media. 'We are seeing a very different picture in Darwin and Perth. The softness in those markets is expected to be ongoing given that the commodity downturn is depressing economic activity in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. 'Stock levels have jumped from a year earlier as vendors struggle to sell their properties for the prices they want in these cities. 'Overall it goes to show there is no national housing bubble forming. Except for Sydney and parts of Melbourne.'

    Toilet paper has become the barometer for how confident people are in their economy and whether they can afford a minor splurge - like a luxury brand . Sales of luxury toilet paper are being heralded as the newest way to measure the economy - and judging by our current spending habits things in Britain are looking up. Spending on products for short-term use is crucial in revealing how confident a country's population are in their own economic prospects - and luxury loo paper sales  suggest the recession is well and truly over. A report by market intelligence firm Euromonitor International found the UK stands out among the European countries as only 5.3 per cent of £1.9billion toilet paper sales were made up from the cheaper brands. The analysts found although top brands like Cushelle, Andrex and Velvet are a little pricier, they are a luxury most people can afford. They said in the report: 'While the idea of luxury toilet paper may be slightly odd, its performance suggests otherwise.' They added that toilet paper has become the barometer for how confident people are in their economy and whether they can afford a minor splurge. Waitrose recently announced that premium toilet tissue sales are up 12 per cent year on year. Victoria Fletcher, the store's paperware buyer, told The Times: 'It's the little luxuries which are sometimes the best.' Abid Ditta from Star Tissue UK told newspaper: 'We have definitely seen an increase in demand for better quality products since we have invested in a new state-of-the-art toilet tissue production line.' Meanwhile sales of luxury toilet paper are also being enjoyed in the US with the market hitting $1.4 billion last year - and sales are still growing. With the recovery of the UK economy consumers have gone back to buying branded products . A report by Euromonitor International found the UK stands out among the European countries because only 5.3 per cent of total toilet paper sales were made up from the cheaper brands - like this Morrisons Value pack . The Washington Post reported luxury toilet paper sales have grown more than 70 percent since 2000. The analysts from Euromonitor wrote in their report: 'Higher growth is expected out of the luxury segment as the improved economy allows consumers to satisfy their desire for comfort.' Toilet paper is not the only unusual way to measure the economy. The Hemline Index was established by economist George Taylor at Wharton School of Business in 1926, when he noticed a correlation between good times and short skirts. When the economy was good women would wear higher hemlines to show off the more expensive hosiery compared to rough times where the skirts would become longer so women could hide their cheap stockings. Autumn/Winter 2015 collections from the biggest fashion houses saw high hemlines at Topshop, Julien MacDonald and Giles - while flares were also a big hit, implying there is money to spend on additional material. Hairstyles are another economic indicator. MailOnline reported earlier this month that the the growing popularity of shorter haircuts is a sign of economic recovery, since they require more frequent trips to the salon and are costlier to maintain. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, who is the face of L'Oreal, debuted her new layered bob just last week on the Graham Norton Show, while Kim Kardashian also recently braved a shorter cut. Toilet paper sales in the UK have grown by 2 per cent over the last year - the industry is worth £1.9 billion .

    The lawyer for a 17-year-old Connecticut boy charged with stabbing a classmate to death in school on their prom day says he intends to use an insanity defense. Christopher Plaskon is charged with murdering 16-year-old Maren Sanchez in a hallway at Jonathan Law High School in Milford in April 2014, just hours before the junior prom. Police are investigating whether it was related to Sanchez's refusal to be Plaskon's prom date. Lawyers for Christopher Plaskon, 17 charged with stabbing a classmate to death in school on their prom day says he intends to use an insanity defense. Plaskon is charged with murdering 16-year-old Maren Sanchez, right, in a hallway at Jonathan Law High School in Milford in April 2014, just hours before the junior prom . Plaskon's lawyer, Richard Meehan, released new court documents on Monday saying he intends to pursue a defense of 'mental disease or defect and/or extreme emotional disturbance.' Meehan has said in court that Plaskon was taking anti-psychotic and anti-anxiety medications. Plaskon is due in Milford Superior Court for a pretrial hearing on Tuesday. Sanchez, 16, was a member of the National Honor Society who was active in drama and other school activities. She had organized the dance herself and was set to be prom queen, her friends said. A witness saw Plaskon on top of Sanchez during the attack and tried unsuccessfully to pull him away, and another saw him discard a bloody knife, according to a police affidavit. Plaskon's lawyer has revealed that he intends to use an insanity defense for his client who was taking anti-psychotic meds . Plaskon, his clothes bloody, was taken to the principal's office, where an officer arrived and asked what happened. 'I did it. Just arrest me,' Plaskon replied, according to the officer. He is being prosecuted as an adult and faces up to 60 years in prison with a mandatory minimum of 25 years if found guilty of murder.

    Illegal immigrants would be put on a plane before they get the chance to appeal under Conservative plans to rip up deportation laws. Home Secretary Theresa May wants to implement a new regime of 'deport first, appeal later'. The rules, to be brought in if the Tories are re-elected, would apply to anyone with an expired visa or those living in Britain without permission. The only exceptions would be asylum-seekers or migrants who could suffer 'irreversible' harm if sent back to a dangerous country. The move seeks to end the racket of thousands of illegal immigrants being able to prolong their stay in Britain for months or even years by lodging a string of appeals and judicial reviews. The only exemptions to the new rules would be asylum seekers or migrants who could suffer 'irreversible harm' if sent back to their home country. File image used . Officials also hope the crackdown – central to Tory manifesto plans to slash net migration – will save the taxpayer money. Migrants will still be able to appeal – but must do so from their country of origin. It is thought that fewer people will then attempt to play the system, sparing the UK taxpayer the cost of holding them in an immigration centre or paying for housing. The Conservative manifesto is yet to be completed and has undergone a series of re-writes in recent weeks. But senior Government sources say it will once again contain a target to slash net migration – with renewed focus on removing more people from the country as a way of achieving it. Mrs May is pressing for a firm restatement of the Prime Minister's 'tens of thousands' target – despite the fact it was missed spectacularly. David Cameron remains committed to slashing net migration – the number of people arriving in the country against those leaving – which currently stands at 298,000. By increasing the number of illegal immigrants who are removed from the country, it makes it easier to hit the target. Until now, the focus has been primarily on reducing the numbers coming in. Home Secretary Theresa May wants to implement a new regime of 'deport first, appeal later' should the Tories gain re-election . Mrs May, hinting at the plans earlier this month, said: 'I think we will keep the target. It is important because it is about not just dealing with those coming into the system, but also about making sure that those people who shouldn't live here actually leave.' Tory insiders are satisfied the so–called 'non-suspensive appeals' policy is legally water-tight and will not be derailed by Labour's Human Rights Act. On a smaller scale, Mrs May has for the past year been deporting foreign criminals under an identical 'deport first, appeal later' regime. So far the move has seen 600 offenders sent home before their appeals were exhausted. Deportees and their lawyers lodged a series of judicial reviews against the scheme in the hope it would be ruled unlawful. But in a string of test cases, judges found there was no barrier to making foreign offenders lodge their claims from their home countries. Those kicked out so far include a Nigerian woman who claimed to have a human right to a family life in the UK – despite being convicted of repeatedly beating her own child. Under the old system she could have delayed her case for years by lodging a string of appeals in the British courts. With an estimated one million illegal immigrants living in the UK, the Home Office has a large group to target. But campaign groups have raised concerns that the department lacks the resources to track them all down. MigrationWatch said the £1.8billion Britain spends securing borders and removing illegal immigrants and foreign criminals was 'clearly inadequate' – and six times less than the estimated £12billion overseas aid budget. While the number of migrants arriving in the UK has increased sharply in recent years, the number being removed has stayed flat at around 100,000 every year. The Mail understands Mr Cameron is considering including two different targets in the final manifesto. In addition to the 'tens of thousands' target, he could also opt for a specific pledge to slash net migration from outside the EU – which, unlike EU migration, ministers can fully control. Earlier this week, research based on an analysis of the British Social Attitudes Survey found voters in every different ethnic group in Britain want immigration reduced. Some 60 per cent of Asian respondents wish to see immigration reduced – 38 per cent by a lot.
Summary target: 
    Theresa May wants to implement new 'deport first, appeal later' regime .
The rules would be brought in if the Tories win the General Election .
Exceptions would only apply to migrants at risk of 'irreversible harm'

    (CNN)A convoy of U.S. Army armored vehicles is drawing crowds, cheers and tears as it makes an 1,100-mile journey from the Baltics through Poland and the Czech Republic to Germany. The trek is being made by troops from the 3rd Squadron, 2nd Cavalry Regiment and is dubbed a "Dragoon Ride" after the unit's nickname, the Dragoons. It is designed to show solidarity to allies in the wake of recent Russian actions in Ukraine and Crimea that have Eastern Europe on edge. "The engagements will provide a highly visible demonstration of U.S. commitment to the residents in each of the nations and the resolve of NATO as an alliance," according to a Pentagon statement. According to reports from the route, it seems to be delivering on that. "This really means a lot to us. We see that we are not alone, that there is someone to defend us," Zdzislaw Narel, 60, told The Associated Press as the convoy made a stop in Bialystok, Poland . "I've read about the former times. For me, what's happening now is a little scary. I think it (the American presence) makes people feel safer," Viktorija Maciulyte, 18, told Stars and Stripes newspaper at a stop in Panevezys, Lithuania. Troops say they can see the effects, too. "The older people start getting emotional. I had one lady came up to me crying," Spc. John Zagozdon, 25, told Stripes. "They were all really grateful." "It makes a difference when you see U.S. soldiers parked in your parking lot," Capt. Jon Challgren is quoted as saying in the Stripes report. The convoy, which began on Saturday, is expected to take 11 days to its end at Rose Barracks in Vilseck, Germany, about 40 miles from the Czech border. It is being supported by NATO military units and U.S. Air Force planes and Army helicopter units for reconnaissance and resupply, according to an Army statement.

    An opulent riverboat dedicated to the Habsburg dynasty's only female ruler is undergoing its final touches just days before it sets sail on its maiden voyage from the Netherlands. Uniworld’s newest luxury passenger vessel, the S.S. Maria Theresa, is being billed as its most majestic ship to date, but members of the media and public won't be able to step foot on it until its first viewing in Amsterdam tomorrow. Two days later, the 150-passenger boat will carry holidaymakers for the first time as it embarks on a 10-day journey from Amsterdam to Antwerp, Belgium, with each guest paying more than £2,500 for the entire trip. Scroll down for videos . The S.S. Maria Theresa's grand lobby features an enormous oil painting of the Habsburg dynasty's only female ruler . Designed by the Red Carnation Hotel Collection, the S.S. Maria Theresa boasts 64 staterooms and 11 suites, including the 410-square foot royal suite. Its smallest staterooms are just over 160 square feet. Guests will enjoy extravagant amenities on board the 443ft vessel, as all of the Baroque-inspired ship's luxury accommodations have fabric wall coverings, plush carpets, antique furnishings and original art. Canopy or four-poster  Savoir beds are another lavish touch, while open-air French balconies on the main and upper decks offer panoramic water views. The grand lobby features a 10-ft oil painting of Maria Theresa, whose 40-year reign ended with her death in 1780. When they’re not in their rooms or above deck passengers can unwind in full-service bars, a restaurant or cinema. The riverboat also has a heated swimming pool, spa, and coffee bar, and guests are treated to in-room butler services. Princess Anita von Hohenberg, a direct descendant of the Habsburg dynasty, will be on hand for the christening of the vessel. Her father, Franz Ferdinand, Duke of Hohenberg, was a grandson of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, an heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian Empire's throne. His assassination in 1914 is widely acknowledged to have sparked the outbreak of the First World War. Staterooms inside the 150-passenger boat feature tasselled shades, chic linens and pillows, and specially-made English Savoir beds . Throughout the vessel, including this reception room, elaborate interior decorations feature Baroque styles and velvet upholstery . The S.S. Maria Theresa's maiden voyage, departing on Saturday, is being called a 'tulips and windmills' tour, as guests will take in some of the Netherlands' iconic sights. Using a network of canals and rivers, the vessel will stop in Hoorn, Nijmegen, Rotterdam and Veer in the Netherlands before calling at Ghent and Antwerp in Belgium. For the inaugural cruise, prices start from £2,504 per person. To upgrade to the royal suite, it will cost an additional £3,175 per person. The year’s most expensive cruise on the S.S. Maria Theresa, a 15-day journey from Budapest to Amsterdam, starts at £4,688 per person, with an additional £2,560 required to secure the royal suite. Much like the public spaces, the suites and staterooms are decorated in a colour scheme that includes royal blue, white and gold . The S.S. Maria Theresa has 64 staterooms in two categories; the smallest staterooms are 162 square feet in size . Kathryn Beadle, Uniworld's managing director for the UK, said in a statement: 'We are thrilled to have Princess Anita von Hohenberg as the godmother of our newest super ship, the S.S. Maria Theresa. 'There is no one more deserving of this honour than the direct descendent of Maria Theresa herself, who ruled for 40 years over an extraordinary and far-reaching empire. 'Guests travelling aboard this magnificent ship will visit sites of historical interest throughout the former Habsburg Empire for a true immersion into Europe's vivid history, whilst enjoying fantastic luxury, comfort and service on board our newest vessel.'

    David Haye insists his long-awaited comeback is still on and is already plotting a route to WBC king – and his old sparring partner – Deontay Wilder. Former two-weight world champion Haye, now 34, has not been seen in the ring since he stopped Dereck Chisora in the fifth round of their thrilling clash at West Ham's Upton Park back in July 2012 . Since then, two fights with British rival Tyson Fury have fallen through, the second of which as a result of shoulder surgery that threatened to end his career for good at the end of 2013. David Haye has vowed to return to the ring after almost three years out of action through injury . Then, last June, Haye revealed that he would fight on and predicted a return to the ring in the following autumn. However he is still yet to re-lace the gloves and it has been suggested that he might never do so again. But 'The Hayemaker' is adamant he will box on, has already set his sights on American knock-out artist Wilder and thinks a world title showdown within just 18 months could be possible. Haye said: 'Yes you will see me back in the ring. I've been taking it easy of late as obviously I had a bad shoulder injury so I needed reconstructive surgery on it. 'That's good now, I've got all the movement back and I'm banging harder than ever with that. I'm just surveying the land at the moment and seeing what's happening out there. 'The heavyweight division is looking as good as it has done for a long time. You've got Wladimir Klitschko still doing what he does, you've got the emergence of Deontay Wilder, the WBC champion, big guy, perfect record. He just had a great win and I was in Vegas when he fought Bermane Stiverne. He looked like the real deal, he really did.' Haye was last in action when he stopped British rival Dereck Chisora at Upton Park in 2012 . Haye knows all about Wilder having shared the ring with him during training back in 2013. Footage of that spar can be found on Youtube and, despite the big gloves and headguard, Haye appears to have the American in real trouble. But it is the 'Bronze Bomber' who now sits on top of the world having beaten Stiverne to win the title, taking his record to 33 wins from 33 fights, with all but one coming inside four rounds. Haye added: 'He helped me out in the past with sparring so I know him very well and I think that has really spiced up the heavyweight division. 'I think a great route would be to go to America and try to navigate a way to the WBC title. Deontay Wilder is a very good champion and if i start fighting regularly I am probably a year or 18 months away from being in a mandatory position to fight him. 'I'm not stupid and I don't think I will just jump straight in there. I think it would be disrespectful to the champions and a bit idiotic of myself to think that just because three years ago I could fight at a good level I can just come straight back . 'Not even Usain Bolt can take three years out and come straight in and expect to beat the world.' It is almost four years since Haye lost a unanimous points decision to Klitschko on a rain-soaked night in Hamburg. Haye twice saw a fight against Tyson Fury fall through after he suffered injuries in training . Since then, all seven of Dr Steelhammer's fights have taken place in Europe. But Klitschko's next outing, a defence of his WBA, WBO and IBF belts against Bryant Jennings, will be at New York's iconic Madison Square Garden on April 25. 'It makes a change,' Haye said. 'In America things are starting to shake up and I think he's realised by continuously fighting in Germany, only German people watch that. 'Worldwide he doesn't do great business and I think he realises time's ticking and he doesn't have many fights left in him. For the next couple of years he wants to really finish his legacy with some really big fights. If he has to travel he has to and he deserves respect for that.' Haye was speaking at a visit to the Double Jab ABC in New Cross as part of Join In and England Boxing's launch of 'Backing Up Boxing'. Their aim is to drive more volunteers to help out at similar boxing clubs across the country. Haye said: 'All of my coaches when I was a kid, from the age of 10 to 20 were volunteers. They weren't getting paid. Out of the goodness of their hearts they came down to Fitzroy Lodge in Lambeth and trained a bunch of kids. 'Even if you don't make a career out of it, there is so much badness out there on the streets on a daily basis. The more youth centres, boxing gyms and football academies, the more stuff we have for kids, stops them smoking, drinking, smoking weed, taking drugs. It's a slippery spiral. 'Hopefully people listening to me will want to try and help. You can go to joininuk.org and see if there is anything you can get involved in.' Haye wants to plot a route that ends with him challenging world champion Deontay Wilder (left)

    The 'disgraceful' reaction from Chelsea players forced referee Bjorn Kuipers to send off Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic during the ill-tempered Champions League tie at Stamford Bridge, said Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher. Carragher's fellow Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness went further, branding Jose Mourinho's players 'pathetic', but co-commentator Gary Neville  defended the Blues for being 'shrewd'. Ibrahimovic was sent off after a lunging challenge on Chelsea's Oscar on the half hour mark but it appeared harsh as both players made forceful tackles. Chelsea players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers as Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is shown a red card for fouling Oscar . The Chelsea players swarm around the referee with team-mate Oscar lying injured on the floor . Ibrahimovic is clearly dejected having been sent off after a collision with Oscar in the first-half . Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher labelled Chelsea players a 'disgrace' for their reaction to Ibrahimovic . The 33-year-old seemed apologetic as soon as he realised the impact of his challenge before the Chelsea players swarmed the referee demanding action. 'It was very unfortunate, it’s not a red card. I actually think he’s trying to pull his foot away. You look at it and you think Oscar’s foot is as high, if not higher,' Carragher said on Sky Sports. ‘If the referee is the other side then the referee might look at Oscar and give the decision the other way.' Carragher insisted the actions from the Chelsea players were the deciding factor in the dismissal. Jamie Carragher (left) and Graeme Souness (second right) slammed the behaviour of the Chelsea players . The 33-year-old heads into this challenge with Oscar (left) in the first-half which got him sent off . 'The reaction from the Chelsea players is disgraceful. It’s something that is sad that is coming into the game. It comes from I think Jose Mourinho’s teams, they have this reaction, it’s not a one off,' added Carragher. Souness branded the actions of Chelsea's squad 'pathetic'. He said: 'In Jamie’s (Carragher) generation, when someone caught you, the last thing you wanted to show your opponent is that you’re injured, today it’s the exact opposite. If someone brushes you, you want to go down and get them in trouble. That’s how pathetic it is. 'Thank goodness PSG stood up to that and leave here with great credit. They are the proper team.' Former Manchester United captain Neville disagreed with his colleagues. He said: ‘Listening to the lads at half-time, I’m not as damning about Chelsea reacting because partly times it happened during my career when you tried to influence the referee. But for far too many times you’ve seen naive English teams in Europe, that have been done on occasions like that. The PSG forward immediately acknowledged his fault in the incident having collided with Oscar . ‘Here, we’ve got a team that is shrewd. People at home might not like it but if the boot was on the other foot we’d be calling PSG shrewd. They play the game, that’s what you need to do in European competition over the last 20, 30 years. It’s different trying to gain those advantages. ‘I like the idea that it’s an English team that is shrewd and not the opposition. It comes from Mourinho, he knows how to play the game.’ However, Neville did acknowledge it was a harsh decision on Ibrahimovic:  'It's not a red card for me, I think that's a poor decision from the referee. He must have got his red card out within two or three seconds.' Chelsea captain John Terry (left) reacts after Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar in the first-half at Stamford Bridge . At half-time, Carragher had also suggested that such intimidation comes from their manager Mourinho: 'I always think with Mourinho’s teams that they will always be respected but they’ll never be loved because of situations like this. 'They take winning to another level that no other team or manager does that I’ve seen over the years.' Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho gestures his dissatisfaction as his side crashed out of the Champions League . 'We all want to win but the reaction of the Chelsea players has definitely played a part and Jose Mourinho’s words in the press conference have worked.' Mourinho, in his post-match interview after his side were beaten on away goals, bemoaned PSG’s apparent time wasting but Carragher dismissed such claims as hypocrisy. ‘Mourinho is the master of time wasting and he did that from the first two minutes at Anfield last year (when Chelsea all but ended Liverpool’s title hopes),' he said. 'I’m not criticising him, I applauded him at the time and I know it’s part of the game, but he can’t complain about PSG and that English football is clean as the only dirty tricks we saw were from Chelsea by surrounding the referee and the reaction was disgraceful.’ The striker is consoled by PSG boss Laurent Blanc as he trudges off the pitch at Stamford Bridge . Carragher also questioned the quality of the Premier League after Chelsea crashed out: 'As a football person you want to see the best teams go through, we want the English teams to do well, to go through and represent our country,' he said at full-time. 'You think of the TV deal, the money we’ve got, we’re getting kidded. You see some of the players PSG have got. Now they’ve paid big money as well but you look at Arsenal, Man City. We’re supposed to be the biggest league in the world, with the best players. We are miles away.' Former Chelsea defender David Luiz jumps into the air in celebration having fired PSG back into the tie . Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness branded the Chelsea players 'pathetic' for their antics on Wednesday . In the Sky studio at full-time Souness was keen to highlight Chelsea's behaviour was 'unacceptable' and was full of praise for the Parisians: . 'It hurts me to say this but Chelsea earlier with their shenanigans early on, with the manager coming out with his talk that this is the most aggressive team we’ve ever played. Saying they are over physical, Mourinho is having a laugh,' Souness told Sky Sports. 'This is a team that is full of technique, a really good footballing team. They had to put up with a lot of stuff I find really unappealing. The Chelsea players are stunned as they were knocked out of the Champions League on Wednesday . 'That is from other players, the minute they come out of the tunnel, the first minute of the game, they are looking to get the opposition in trouble, get them booked, see if they can get them sent off. The reaction from the Chelsea players on the challenge on Oscar opitimises what I’m saying,' added Souness. 'To a man they were surrounding the referee, even Costa ran 50 yards to get involved. Oscar originally wasn’t going to get involved and then you can see in the pictures that as soon as his team-mates all raising their arms around the referee, then he gets involved. 'That’s something we can deal without, It’s not the British way of doing things and it is creeping into our game which I find it totally unacceptable.' Luiz and the PSG squad celebrate moving into the quarter-finals in front of their adouring fans .

    Chris Coleman will name Sam Vokes in a Wales squad for the first time in a year on Wednesday - and believes that allows Gareth Bale to spell more danger for his country. Vokes has not featured for Wales since scoring in a 3-1 victory over Iceland last March as he ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament three weeks after that Cardiff friendly. But striker Vokes has been a regular off the Burnley bench since Christmas and started his first Barclays Premier League game on Saturday when the Clarets shocked Manchester City to win 1-0 at Turf Moor. Burnley striker Sam Vokes has earned a call up to the Wales squad after impressing for the Clarets . Vokes (right) scored on his second appearance back from injury during his side's 1-1 draw with Tottenham . That has convinced Coleman he is ready to play some part in the crunch European Championship qualifier against Israel on March 28 and free Bale again to cause maximum damage in Haifa. 'He obviously missed the start of the season after his injury but he's had some games and minutes under his belt now,' said Coleman. 'It's good for us because Sam gives us something different. 'He's not just a big target man, he's got a bit more to him than that and it will be good to have the big man back . 'Maybe he can come on for half an hour or play for an hour if he starts because defenders don't like playing against that very strong and brave forward who can get a goal.' Vokes' return also spells good news for Coleman as far as the deployment of Bale is concerned, especially as his main man ended his nine-game scoring drought on Sunday by scoring both goals in Real Madrid's 2-0 league victory over Levante. Bale has often had to plough a lone furrow in Vokes' absence rather than causing mayhem when cutting in from either flank. Gareth Bale, pictured after scoring against Andorra, has led Wales' forward line in the absence of Vokes . The Real superstar scored twice in Wales' opening 2-1 Euro 2016 win in Andorra in September to make it 11 goals in his last 16 international appearances but he has not found the net in the three qualifiers since. 'Maybe we can now release Gareth somewhere else,' Coleman said. 'Gareth's been up there by himself because in the last camp Simon Church was also injured and he's had a job to do for us. 'But we can look at it with another angle with big Sam coming back.' Coleman's side head to Haifa with themselves and Israel the surprise early front-runners in Group B and fancied pair Belgium and Bosnia-Herzegovina having ground to make up in the section. Group leaders Israel have won their opening three games while unbeaten Wales lie in second place after beating Andorra and Cyprus and picking up points against Belgium and Bosnia. Wales boss Chris Coleman is hoping Vokes' return will allow Bale to return to his natural role . Coleman has hit on a settled side and he hopes he will be able to call on Hull defender James Chester, who has been out of action since dislocating a shoulder in January. Chester has been a revelation since joining the set-up last year and has developed a formidable centre-back pairing alongside captain Ashley Williams, with Wales conceding only twice in four qualification games so far. 'It will be touch-and-go for James and he's done brilliant for us,' Coleman said. 'But we're lucky we've got someone of James Collins' experience to come in. 'He's got the type of mentality to go to a place like Israel where it will be heated and front it up and lead. 'It's going to be tough because they're top on merit but if we're serious about qualifying we've got to go there and get something.'
Summary target: 
    Burnley's Sam Vokes will be named in Wales squad for first time in year .
Vokes impressed for Burnley in their shock win against Manchester City .
Wales boss Chris Coleman hopes Vokes' return will free up Gareth Bale .
Summarized text:

    One mother has learned that the kindness of strangers can be boundless after her seriously ill daughter lost her 'bravery bracelet'. Madelyn McKinnon, from Brisbane, has undergone countless surgeries, procedures and treatments in her two short years, and to help her along the way her family bought her a silver bracelet from Pandora. Each charm on the piece of jewellery represented an obstacle she had overcome, or a milestone she surpassed, and so held special meaning for the McKinnon family and Madelyn's mother Melissa. 'It’s basically Maddy's life on a bracelet, she’s been through a lot in her time,' Melissa McKinnon told Daily Mail Australia. Madelyn McKinnon, who is almost two, lost her 'bravery bracelet' (pictured on her arm) last week at hospital . Maddy's mum Melissa McKinnon was devastated when the special bangle - a representation of her daughter's life, went missing . Thanks to the kindness of strangers who donated money and Pandora who donated an entirely new bracelet Maddy's again has a special bangle . But on Wednesday just after Madelyn, who is two this week, had been admitted to the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in Brisbane for more treatment, somewhere between the cafeteria and her room the bangle went missing. When a head-to-toe search and retracing of footsteps turned up nothing, Ms McKinnon took to Facebook to ask for help recovering the symbolic bracelet. 'Yes, the bracelet is very pretty and is quite expensive for a 23-month-old but if only you knew what she had to endure for those charms,' the young girl's mother wrote. 'She has been on life support, had countless surgeries, MRI's, Lumbar punctures, EEG's, blood tests, infusions, transfusions to just name a few. Our daughter is a very sick child and has been since she was 5 weeks old and her Pandora bracelet is to recognise her bravery.' Ms McKinnon also said she had checked with hospital security, volunteers and staff and reported the matter to the police but had not managed to recover the bangle. She said the overwhelming feeling when she first realised the bracelet was missing was 'grief'. This replacement bracelet was gifted to Maddy just days ago, and now holds even more meaning for the McKinnon family . Strangers and friends raised over $1100 for young Madelyn in just hours . The young girl, who is almost two, has been sick since she was just weeks old and now the money raised for her bracelet will go towards a new wheelchair . 'It was very emotional for us and we were just absolutely gutted … it's something that means so much and has sentimental value behind it,' Ms McKinnon said. Madelyn has been very ill since she was just weeks old, when she suffered a series of life-threatening infections which left her with brain damage. At the end of August, she was diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, which means Ms McKinnon and her partner Marcus are at the hospital monthly, while caring for the six other children in their blended family. Friends and strangers alike were touched by Maddy's story and soon Ms McKinnon was flooded with messages and donations from people wanting to help, through a Facebook page called Brisbane Lost And Found. 'I put a post on that (page) and literally within minutes we had people commenting on there wanting to replace a charm. 'The response we had was just so overwhelming and I was left just speechless,' Ms McKinnon revealed. Friends and strangers alike were touched by Maddy's story this week and soon Ms McKinnon was flooded with messages and donations from people wanting to help . 'The response we had was just so overwhelming and I was left just speechless,' Madelyn's mother Melissa McKinnon revealed . Maddy's ongoing treatment is very expensive and she has six other siblings in her 'blended' family . People offered to replace the charms or bracelet for Madelyn, and soon more than $1000 had been raised. But Ms McKinnon was shocked again when the Pandora store visited by a kind stranger intending to replace the bangle with donations offered to give Madelyn a brand new piece of jewellery and all the charms she lost free of charge. 'There was one lady by the name of Natalie and she ended up coordinating the whole thing for us,' Ms McKinnon said, describing the stranger as a 'beautiful lady'. Before Natalie went to Pandora Mt Ommaney to pick out the new bracelet, another woman in the group had emailed the company's head office directly, explaining Maddy's situation. The store then offered to donate a replacement bracelet, as did two other stores in the area. 'Everybody just pulled in, and then we ended up having three Pandora stores wanting to donate,' Ms McKinnon said. The Brisbane girl has been sick since she was just weeks old, pictured her on life support . 'It just restores your faith in humanity,' Ms McKinnon said . 'We never expected it to end up like this... To have this response makes you so proud to be Australian. 'It just restores your faith in humanity,' she added. The ongoing cost of Madelyn's ongoing treatment is very expensive, and now the McKinnon's have a little extra to help them out after so much was raised for the bracelet. 'The money that was originally raised to go towards charms.. is now being raised to pay for the remaining amount for her wheelchair,' Ms McKinnon said. 'To have the response that we did was just so heartwarming and so generous and kind . 'These are complete strangers, now we feel like she’s sharing her journey,' Ms McKinnon said. 'Now that bracelet has an entire new meaning… she now got a bracelet that shows Australia is with her.' If you would like to donate towards the cost of Madelyn McKinnon's ongoing treatment you can visit her GoFundMe page here, or keep up with her journey on her Facebook page here.

    From witnessing the breathtakingly beauty of the Guerrero mountain range to getting food poisoning in Morocco, David Brain experienced more than just feats of brilliance while filming World’s Most Talented. The 31-year-old co-host of the interactive talent show, which will be broadcast for the first time tonight, travelled to India, Mexico, Italy, Argentina and Morocco and caught up with four people from each country. His first stop on the tour was India, a place he ventured through on planes, trains and bikes and described as ‘crazy on every single level’ – a billing that stunt couple Mr and Mrs Budati certainly lived up to. Scroll down for video . David Brain, 31, the co-host of World's Most Talented, which will broadcast for the first time tonight at 9pm on Watch . Filmed in the middle of a jungle, Mr Budati demonstrated his outrageous ability to rest a coconut on his wife’s throat and slash it in two with a machete, leaving her entirely unharmed. Discussing the stunt, David Brain told MailOnline Travel: ‘The local village came down to watch the event and all of them were really calm – I was this flappy English bloke who wasn’t sure about it. ‘I was genuinely worried. My facial expression as it is seen on the show was real.’ According to Mr Budati, he approaches the stunt by removing the audience and consequences from his thoughts and remaining calm – a state of mind every Indian competitor seemed to possess, remarked David. Mr Budati demonstrated his  ability to rest a coconut on his wife’s throat and slice it in two with a machete . Mr Budati says that he approaches the stunt by removing the audience and consequences from his thoughts and remaining calm . Serenity was also a theme in Argentina, where David got to witness what would retrospectively become one of his favourite performances of the series – Gaucho cowboy Martin Tatta  performing horse yoga. ‘Martin Tatta was one of my favourite performers for personal reasons – I’m a bit wary of horses,' said David. ‘His relationship with the horse was just so good, so calming. He uses no equipment and never uses violence or a whip, the bond is created by total respect and trust – it was a real moment.’ The London-based presenter even admitted that had he been able to adopt an ability for himself, he would have chosen Mr Tatta’s, as the skill would impress his partner – a horse enthusiast. Argentine Gaucho cowboy Martin Tatta exerted complete control over a horse while performing yoga with it . David admitted that had he been able to adopt an ability for himself he would have chosen Mr Tatta's so that he could impress his partner . ‘It would have to be the horse yoga, even though there are things that were definitely cooler. She [his partner] would be pleased if she came in and saw me with one relaxed on the floor,’ he said. ‘Also, I like the idea of serenity and chilling out, especially as I live in London, and Martin’s performance was the purest moment of utter serenity.’ Despite the moments of tranquillity experienced on the trip, David also endured his fair share of turmoil and a bout of food poisoning in Morocco certainly took its toll. David said: ‘We filmed India and Morocco together and I was careful that everything was piping hot and that I wasn’t going to eat meat in India – I was militant. David described Aziz Salhi as a real showman and was impressed by his strength and ability . The presenter noted that the road had been closed and 500 people had turned out to witness Aziz Salhi's show of strength . ‘So when I got to Morocco I felt like I had survived India and paid a hefty price for playing with the rules. All I’m saying is don’t have the Caesar salad in Casablanca.’ Morocco however did bring about some of David’s favourite moments and he recalls going to visit strongman Aziz Salhi, who holds off accelerating cars and keeps hold off accelerating motorbikes. ‘He was one of my favourite spectacles – a real showman. He told us that he had spoken to the government and that they were shutting down the roads for his stunt. ‘We were dubious, but we drove to the place and there must have been about 500 people, which included police and motorbike gangs outside the town hall. Pizza freestlyers Antonia and Vincenzo Scapicchio throw pizza dough among the young and hip people of Italy . David was impressed by the youngster's showmanship and stated that he had a 'Christina Aguilera level of attitude' ‘There was a lady there who must have been about 700-years-old, her son, or grandson, [the performer] wheeled her to the front and there were motorbikes doing wheelies next to her – I thought she was going to pass out. ‘Their crowd control was motorbikes doing doughnuts. Health and safety would never allow that to happen in the UK, but no one was hurt.’ Moving on to Italy, David found more excitable people and none encapsulated the sentiment more than father and son team Antonia and Vincenzo Scapicchio, the pizza freestylers. ‘Italy is a really nice place,’ said David, ‘the people look like they have walked out of a beauty advert. Not sure what to make of it! David admits that he was slightly confused by the pizza freestylers' act . ‘And in the middle of all these young and hip people is a man and his son, who eat a lot of pizza, throwing pizza dough. ‘It looked like they were stripping. I thought I was having some weird dream. Part of me felt like it was the best thing I had ever seen and the other part was thinking what are they doing? ‘The kid was really working the camera though, with a Christina Aguilera level of attitude.’ David’s visit to Mexico also brought about its fair share of interesting characters, and the country itself had a profound effect on the presenter. Mexican performer Eduardo Flores gets into position before head-butting a real nail threw a piece of wood . Shock horror! David recoils after watching Mr Flores use his head to hammer a nail through a piece of wood . He said: ‘At first I was annoyed that I was going to Mexico instead of Sweden. I am marrying a Swedish girl and she was saying that I know the country and could do a good job there.’ ‘But Mexico was so much fun. It was a place that really got me. Not so much Mexico City, but when we travelled to Acapulco we drove through a mountain range and it was just stunning, absolutely gorgeous. ‘People say it’s dangerous but I didn’t experience any of that, just very nice, friendly people.’ David’s meeting with Eduardo Flores while in Mexico, however – a man who head-butted a nail into a piece of wood – was less easy on the eye. Cool under pressure! In scorching temperature Khivraj Gurjar performs some controlled BMX yoga on a mountain . ‘He was there banging his forehead on this nail. I held it and it was definitely a nail,' said the presenter. ‘He was smashing concrete blocks up with his fist, and at the end he was really pumped and grabbed and shook my hand. When I took my hand away it was covered in blood.’ Other performances that caught David's eye during the series included a man named Khivraj Gurjar, who performed bike yoga while perched precariously from the side of a mountain in India. Describing the temperature as ‘hotter than the surface of the sun’, David explained how Mr Gurjar was completely serene as he balanced from his BMX. David enjoying himself by having a few midday drinks with breakdancing group Impacto Crew  in Mexico . A breakdancing group called Impacto Crew, who the presenter admits getting slightly drunk with in the midday Mexican sun, also evoked fond memories for the presenter. 'There were 40 people doing shots of Tequilla, singing songs and dancing. It was a crazy atmosphere but the acts were fantastic,' said David. However, not all performance went entirely to plan over the course of the series and a number of incidents saw proceedings become momentarily stalled. The performance of a young limbo skater called Gagan Satish resulted in some off-screen controversy with parents complaining that their children were not picked in place of the youngster. Young limbo skater  Gagan Satish was eventually able to perform after an argument momentarily hampered the show's progression . 'They were shouting at one another and driving their cars away to prevent him from performing,' recalls the presenter. Nature also played its part, with heavy rain in India temporarily hampering archer Jayalakshmi Sariknoda hopes of competing on the show. While rain and wind in Argentina halted the progression of tightrope walker Sebastian Petriw. In the end however all the performances were completed, and given the complexities involved, the filming of the show was ultimately a success. World’s Most Talented with air tonight at 9pm on Watch and the first episode will see India compete with Romania for the coveted crown. Indian archer Jayalakshmi Sariknoda was also able to perform after heavy rain had initially prevented her .

    A Virginia math teacher is facing a maximum of 22 years in prison for having sex with four of her students. Erica Mesa, 28, pleaded guilty on Friday to two counts of electronic solicitation of a minor and two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Mesa taught math at Colonial Forge High School. She pleaded guilty to charges involving two students but admitted having sex with two others aged 16 to 18. Scroll down for video . Virginia math teacher Erica Mesa, 28, is facing a maximum of 22 years in prison for having sex with four of her students . Workplace scandal: Mesa enjoyed sexual relations with four of her pupils at Colonial Forge High School, where both she and her husband worked as teachers . In exchange for Mesa’s guilty pleas, prosecutors dropped four charges and reduced two others. Mesa, who has been in jail since her arrest last September, will be sentenced at Stafford Circuit Court on May 21, reports The Free Lance-Star. Officials at the high school were tipped off by anonymous phone call informing them that the geometry and statistics teacher had allegedly had sex with a male student. An investigation revealed that one of the students was 16 years old when the relationship began in late 2013. Investigators also found out that Mesa allegedly sent nude photos of herself using her cell phone. Most of the trysts allegedly happened at Mesa's home while her husband wasn't around and one had happened in her SUV. Erica married Keith Mesa (left) in 2012 after three years of dating. The couple have split up following her arrest last years on charges of sleeping with her students, including one who was under 18 years old . Mesa admitted to having sex with one teen while another was in her basement waiting his turn. She told authorities she had done it because it made her feel 'attractive and wanted.' The math teacher had worked at Colonial Forge High School since 2009. As well as losing her job, the teacher's marriage had also disolved as a result of her actions. Her husband of two years, Keith Mesa, works at Colonial Forge as a social studies teacher and head volleyball coach. Mesa had coached the volleyball team alongside her husband. According to the couple's wedding site, the two had only got married July 21, 2012, in Michigan. Mesa graduated from Concordia University Ann Arbor, where she studied secondary education with a concentration in math and biology, and played volleyball. Mesa taught geometry while her husband of two years worked as a social studies teacher. They coached the volleyball team together . Defense attorney Mark Gardner said Mesa is not a pedophile and ‘was not preying on people who had no interest in participating.’ He had asked Judge Victoria Willis to release Mesa on bond until her sentencing, but the request was denied. Judge Willis said Mesa would have to 'clean up the mess you have made.' Her guilty pleas means she will have to register as a sex offender.

    Despite years of experience as a handler, Jason McDonald just wasn't quick enough to escape the powerful jaws of this eight foot gator. This dramatic video shows the moment the gator wrestler was taught a painful lesson during a stunt for visitors. It shows him struggling to free himself after a risky trick - involving him putting his hand in the creature's mouth - backfired and the gator clamped his teeth down and refused to let go. Scroll down for video . Ouch! Experienced gator wrestler Jason McDonald had never been bitten before, until a risky trick backfired . The 34-year-old's hand was trapped inside the alligator's mouth for more than 10 minutes. He was eventually released when friends and co-workers prised open the 150lb beast's mouth with a piece of metal. Mr McDonald, who has been volunteering at Colorado Gator Farm in Mosca, Colorado, for 10 years, had never been bitten before. He said: 'I've had many close calls before and I would still have my unbitten streak if I hadn't attempted that dangerous trick. Bait: The experienced handler was taught a painful lesson during a stunt for visitors at Colorado Gator Farm . 'I was in disbelief when it bit me and I was a little mad and disappointed in myself that I had allowed it to happen. 'But I've seen plenty of other people getting bit so I didn't panic at all.' He added employees tried to help him by wedging the creature's mouth open with stick - but it only led to the gator clamping down harder. 'I knew I had to control the head and keep the gator from rolling or shaking its head and causing me further injury,' he said. 'The bite started to hurt a little more as we tried to put sticks in its mouth to wedge it open - every time something touched the inside of its mouth it would clamp down harder. 'Once we were able to pry its mouth open and my hand was free it felt numb - I had one puncture wound that was about half an inch deep and was filled up with blood.' Mr McDonald's girlfriend was filming as he prepared to perform the risky stunt at the farm in Mosca, Colorado . Keep calm: Mr McDonald kept a cool head as his hand was trapped in the alligator's jaws for ten minutes . Finally free: The 34-year-old was eventually released after co-workers pried open the gator's mouth with metal . Injuries: Mr McDonald had to have a cotton bud, dipped in bleach water, inserted into his wounded hand, left, and right, the injuries to his right hand after the ordeal . But he added that despite the ordeal, he will continue handling and treating alligators. 'At no point was I ever in shock. The worst part was when we used a cotton bud with bleach water to clean out the wound and prevent infection. 'I have no ill will towards the gator at all. I honestly have no idea why it closed its mouth and I plan on continuing to catch gators and teach my wrestling class - I just won't be doing that trick anymore.' Mr McDonald, who treats and cares for the rescued animals, is a crematory manager - but in his spare time performs tricks for visitors to the farm. He became involved with Colorado Gators when he signed up for a wrestling class. Colorado Gators started out as a fish farm, but in 1987, its owners decided to buy 100 baby gators, as a means of disposing of guts and carcasses.

    At least one lab employee has tested positive for a deadly bacteria used to make bioweapons that mysteriously escaped a Louisiana research center in November. Additionally, the number of monkey's infected by the bioterror bacterium at the Tulane Prime Research Center has increased from eight to nine and are expected to continue rising, officials say. Three of the monkeys have already been euthanized after showing signs of Burkholderia pseudomallei, which was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500-acre facility. The test results showed the employee was 'just at the threshold for a verified positive result' and has not shown any symptoms of the diseases the bacteria can bring on, such as tuberculosis, according to NOLA.com. Despite thorough investigations by bothb federal and state authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the cause of the contamination is still unknown. Concerns: Monkeys at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana were exposed to a potentially deadly bacteria last fall - but authorities still do not know how or why it happened . Reach: Worryingly, the center is close to a river (top left), homes and a school. Although there are no signs that surrounding areas have been exposed to the bacteria, further tests are required . The name of the employee has not been released. Questions also remain over how far the bacteria, which is primarily found in southeast Asia and northeast Australia, has spread around the complex and surrounding areas. Animals pass it in their urine and feces - potentially contaminating the ground and water around them - and others can become infected through direct contact with the contaminated areas. The bacteria may not cause an illness until days or years after the exposure, but the illness can be fatal in humans and animals, according to USA Today. The monkeys, rhesus macaques, had access to massive outdoor primate breeding cages, where around 4,000 macaques are kept. It is not yet known if the bacteria have colonized in the cages. Worryingly, the research center is just half a mile from a school and surrounded by homes. And only yards behind the facility, there is a river that leads to a lake surrounded by wildlife refuges. The contaminated primates were all at the center's veterinary hospital at the same time last fall, leading to speculation that they could have been exposed there. Infected: At least seven rhesus macaques (file picture) have shown signs of exposure and three have died . Potentially deadly: Burkholderia pseudomallei . The bacteria, Burkholderia pseudomallei, can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis. Melioidosis commonly involves the lungs and has a range of symptoms including fever, headache, appetite loss, muscle and joint pain. The illness may not develop for days to years. It is often mistaken as pneumonia or tuberculosis, and if left untreated, it is fatal. Several countries have looked into using the bacteria as a bioweapon because strains can be resistant to multiple antibiotics. The overall mortality rate is 40 per cent but in Thailand, where the bacteria is endemic, it is up to 50 per cent. The bacteria, which is primarily found in southeast Asia and northeast Australia, has never been found in nature in the U.S. Last week, tests by the CDC determined two further monkeys showed signs of contracting the bacteria, bring the number of infected monkeys to seven. The CDC will now be looking at safety and health practices at the veterinary hospital, the agency said. Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert from Rutgers University in New Jersey, previously told USA Today that the release was worrying. 'The fact that they can't identify how this release occurred is very concerning,' he said. 'Human error is always the first explanation you should consider for a laboratory accident. 'The easiest way to transfer something from one place where it's supposed to be, to another where it isn't supposed to be is by a worker moving from one place to the other.' State officials are planning to test wildlife and domestic animals around the facility to see if they have been exposed. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is also working on information to give animal owners, veterinarians and laboratories on what signs to look for to determine if animals have been exposed. Authorities have previously said they are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk. Only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds and 13 from water - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in Thailand. Those results showed that there was no evidence that the bacteria had spread into the surrounding area, suggesting there was no public health risk.
Summary target: 
    At least nine rhesus macaques at Tulane National Primate Research Center were exposed to Burkholderia pseudomallei, a deadly bacteria .
They were exposed even though the bacterium was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500-acre Louisiana research complex .
One employee tested positive 'just at the threshold'
Initial tests indicate that it has not spread to surrounding areas - which include a school and homes - but further tests are required .
The potentially deadly bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, is not found in the U.S. and can be contracted through contact with contaminated areas .
Summarized text: 
    At least one lab worker has tested positive for a bacteria used to make bioweaves that mysteriously escaped. Three monkeys have already been killed after showing signs of Burkholderian pseudomallei, which was being studied in another part of the facility - but authorities still do not know how or why it happened at Tulane National Primate Research Center 'in November" Three of those monkey were euthanized after showing symptoms of the bacteria and are expected on as the number of monkeys will continue rising if more tests are required

    Kell Brook is talking about fighting Floyd Mayeather or Manny Pacquiao, Juan Manuel Marquez or Brandon Rios — in no given order — before a Wembley blockbuster with Amir Khan sometime next year. Nothing wrong with ambition but the first question Brook has to answer comes in his home town of Sheffield tonight. It has less to do with his undeniable boxing ability than with whether he truly is recovered from the machete attack which inflicted horrific wounds to his left leg. Kell Brook poses on the scales at the weigh in ahead of his match with title challenger Jo Jo Dan . Brook will defend his IBF welterweight title against Dan in his home city of Sheffield on Saturday night . Brook assures us that all is well following that bizarre incident in Tenerife where he was celebrating the stunning win over American Shawn Porter which gained him the IBF world welterweight title. Eddie Hearn, his Matchroom promoter, tells of how demonically Brook has laboured in the intervening six months to rescue his career from near death and the fear of never walking again. But what no-one can know until he climbs into the ring as a world champion for the first time is whether there is any residual damage. For a boxer there is more to getting better than for most of us. It is with the legs that a prizefighter exercises his thrusting mobility. It is from the legs that he generates the majority of his punching power. Brook is set to compete less than six months after a horrific stab attack nearly left him dead in Tenerife . Dan poses on the scales at the weigh in ahead of his title match with IBF welterweight champion Brook . Brook's attack left him with a 12-inch wound on his thigh and he has shown great strength to recover . If either his balance or strength in that leg has been sapped, Brook will find it doubly difficult to perform at elite level. If both are reduced, he will be diminished. Thus the examination about to be conducted by his moderate challenger, Jo Jo Dan, will be more medical than a test of Brook’s talent. With older boxers it is the legs that go first. But you never find out for sure until he is engaged in the heat of battle. Close scrutiny on Sky television will determine whether Brook, at 28, has been slowed prematurely. A small impediment is unlikely to be enough to deprive him of a homecoming victory, even though Romanian- born, Canadian-based Dan insists he has prepared himself to shut out the roar of Brook’s partisan support. Brook claimed the IBF welterweight title in 2014 when he defeated the previous holder Shawn Porter (left) But the issue is whether he wins in athletic style, with the ‘five-star performance’ he is promising his fans. The local crowd, those of us at ringside and British boxing at large will be hoping he can. If so, he will travel to Las Vegas for May 2 to be ringside for the Fight of the Century, eager to argue his case for meeting the winner of Pacquiao and Mayweather in a world welterweight unification fight. That is markedly less likely to happen than an autumn fight with Rios, en route to an eventual showdown with Khan. But if Brook puts on a show this weekend there would be no harm in asking. Brook and Dan square up with one another ahead of their IBF title match in Sheffield on Saturday . Brook has also expressed an interest in facing Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao in the near future . Brook and Dan shake hands ahead of their IBF welterweight title match in Sheffield on Saturday . Brook v Dan is live on Sky Sports 1 from 7.30pm .
Summary target: 
    Kell Brook will defend his IBF welterweight title against Jo Jo Dan less than six months after a horrific machete attack which almost killed him .
The 28-year-old will headline in his home city of Sheffield on Saturday having worked his way up through the local gyms and leisure centres .
Brook says that the stabbing ordeal has helped to make him stronger .
Summarized text: 
    Kell Brook is preparing to defend his IBF world title against Jojo Dan. Brook has been fighting Floyd Mayeather or Manny Pacquiao, Juan Manuel Marquez or Brandon Rios before he fights Amir Khan in May - no doubt about it! Brook will be battling challenger Dan in Sheffield on Saturday night if he is fully recovered from the horrific stabbing incident involving Shawn Porter 'Jake' Porter.

    FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told Qatar 'more must be done' to improve working conditions in the country as it prepares to stage the 2022 World Cup. Blatter visited Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, who has previously acknowledged setbacks in development work that according to the International Trade Union Confederation has already cost 1,000 migrant worker lives. The Emir said last year that new legal frameworks have been introduced to improve the situation on the ground. Sepp Blatter says Qatar must do more for workers as they build ahead of the 2022 World Cup . Blatter said he wanted to meet Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani in person before next week's meeting . Ahead of the FIFA executive committee meeting in Zurich on Thursday and Friday, when dates for the 2022 tournament are expected to be determined, Blatter urged Qatar to ensure all workers are guaranteed 'fair' conditions. Blatter said: 'It was important for me to have an opportunity to get the latest information directly from the highest political authority, ahead of the executive committee meeting next week. 'It is encouraging to hear the Emir's personal commitment to workers' welfare and to get a sense of the improvements planned for all workers in Qatar. The decision to award the World Cup to Qatar, which has questionable labour laws, has been controversial . 'As various human-rights groups have recently noted, progress has been made already, especially with regard to the standards introduced by the supreme committee relating to 2022 construction sites, but more must be done in Qatar to ensure uniformly fair working conditions for all. 'This will only be possible through the collective effort of all stakeholders - from the construction companies to the authorities. It is clear that Qatar takes its responsibility as host seriously and sees the FIFA World Cup as a catalyst for positive social change.'

    He's considered one of the MLB's most promising prospects, but Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Daniel Norris has chosen to escape the hype surrounding his baseball career by living out of a 1978 Volkswagon van outside a Wal-Mart. Predictably earning himself the nickname 'Van Man', the 21-year-old - who received a $2 million signing bonus -  has currently parked the camper outside one of the mega-stores in the suburbs of Florida, saying it brings him peace of mind. He works out in the carpark, cooks his meals - mostly eggs and stir fries - on a portable stove and likes to go surfing during the day. 'It's like a yin-and-yang thing for me,' he told ESPN in a new interview. 'It's like a yin-and-yang thing for me': Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Daniel Norris has chosen to escape the hype surrounding his baseball career by living out of 1978 Volkswagon camper he bought for $10,000 . Twins: Having traveled all over in the van, Norris has now pulled up stumps at a Wal-Mart in suburban Florida . 'I'm not going to change who I am just because people think it's weird. 'The only way I'm going to have a great season is by starting out happy and balanced and continuing to be me. 'It might be unconventional, but to feel good about life I need to have some adventure.' Norris paid $10,000 for the van in 2011 - straight after high school. He refers to it as 'Shaggy'. Norris doesn't spend all his time outside Wal-Mart. While there, he likes to read Jack Kerouac at night using a torch, but he also goes on trips through the mountains of Tennessee and to surfing destinations along the Carolina coast. At work: When not parked outside a Wal-Mart, surfing or on a road trip,  Daniel Norris is considered by many as the 'future' of the Toronto Blue Jays . Alternative: Beyond his quirks, Norris maintains his head is always in the game . Life on the road: With a love of the outdoors running in his family, the left-handed pitcher from Johnson City, Tennessee spends his the off-season camping in mountains and driving on the open road . He then drives to spring training in Florida. Norris hit the major league last year and hopes to make the Jays rotation this year. While he has become much more well-known for his alternative lifestyle, Norris maintains his focus is and always has been the game. 'Baseball's been my No. 1 passion my whole life,' Norris told Baseball America. "All the stuff with the van is cool and (a good story) and that's fine, but baseball is my main focus. 'That's my main passion and what I think about the most.' Fan club: Daniel Norris is seen here in a photo from his Twitter page. He says he has gotten used to 'people staring' at how he camps out in carparks . Toronto Sun baseball columnist Bob Elliot recently said that, beyond his quirks, Norris has the sporting goods to back it up. 'To Blue Jays decision-makers and Blue Jays fans, it matters only if he can get people out, Elliot wrote. 'Well, so far ... so good. 'In his first start of the spring, as he tries to win a starting rotation spot, Norris worked a scoreless 1.2 'innings on Thursday night at Ed Smith Stadium, allowing two base-runners, while facing basically the Baltimore Orioles’ opening day lineup.' Interior: Norris keeps all his belongings - he owns one pair of jeans - in the Volkswagon .

    How about some Vegemite ice-cream with Weet Bix on top? The ultra-Aussie confection is just one of the weird and wacky flavours being concocted by an adventurous, multi-award winning, ice-cream connoisseur. Dooley's Ice Cream parlour in Apollo Bay, on Victoria's famous Great Ocean Road, is known for producing some of the oddest combinations in ice-cream - and its Vegemite flavour may be the strangest yet. Owner Dooley Milner told Daily Mail Australia the flavour is a massive hit with international tourists and 'gets people talking'. Dooley's Ice Cream Parlour on the Great Ocean Road has released a Vegemite flavour . But others are not so keen, saying the black, salty yeast byproduct is not well suited to ice cream. Dooley's, which has won 370 awards for excellence, often creates unique flavours in the run-up to special events. Just before Christmas, Dooley's made a Xmas Pudding flavour and for Australia Day the shop made a Lamington flavour. But it's Vegemite  that has stood the test of time. The parlour first introduced the unique ice-cream on Australia Day in 2011 and it has been on the shelves ever since. In 2012, it won a silver award at the Royal Melbourne Show and the parlour's vanilla flavour has been voted the number one ice-cream in Australia at the Australian Grand Dairy Awards 2015. 'I've stuck with it since. It has been received quite well.' Mr Milner said. The famous shop, which is visited each day by hundreds of tourists, has a range of odd flavours on display . 76-year-old Dooley Milner has been running the parlour for the past 14 years and his daughter Alyciandra came on-board in 2007 .

    They may look like they are from different families, but believe it or not Jayden and Xavier Boughey are actually twins. The adorable 11-year-old boys, who hail from Auckland in New Zealand, were born with contrasting skin tones - Jayden has a dark complexion and Xavier is white. And as if questions over the colour of their skin wasn't enough for the young fellas, they also have the added complication of having different birthdays - with Jayden being born on November 6 and Xavier coming into the world after midnight, making his birthday November 7. Scroll down for video . Jayden and Xavier Boughey may look like they are from different families but they are in fact twins . The gorgeous 11-year-old boys also have different birthdays after Xavier (right) was born after midnight . The beautiful boys, who look strikingly alike despite their obvious differences, have their parents to thank for their mishmash of genes. Their mother, Helen Castles, 32. brings the dark skin to the family, which she inherited from her grandmother, who is Samoan. Their father is the complete opposite - Phil Boughey, 36, has a white complexion and fair hair. When the pair found out they were expecting twins, they wondered how their children would look, but could  never could have dreamed of the conclusion. 'We were surprised for sure - the running joke is because they were made in the Bahamas that Helen had the local Bohemian milkman stop by one day when I was at work to make the brown one,' their dad Phil Boughey told Daily Mail Australia. 'But we don't really see it as a huge deal they just look different like any siblings can.' Their parents joke that because the boys were conceived in the Bahamas the local milkman dropped by to make the 'brown one' Xavier (left) is carefree and Jayden (right) is responsible and as the oldest of the two is a born leader . Now the boys have just started a new school, Sacred Heart, and are tasked with the unenviable challenge of trying to explain to their peers that they are related. 'They do get a lot of people believing they are not twins especially school kids,' he said. 'We make sure they are in different classes at school too because Jayden is the stronger one and Xavier will just sit back and ride on the coat tails of Jayden - so we have had to pull him out of the clouds.' The odds of a mixed race couple having twins of different colours are a million to one. Skin colour is believed to be determined by up to seven different genes working together. If a parent is of mixed race, their eggs or sperm will contain a mixture of genetic codes for both black and white skin. However, if both the egg and sperm contain all white genes, the baby will be white. And if both contain just the versions necessary for black skin, the baby will be black. But the boys embrace the attention they get for looking so different. 'They think it's perfect - they think it's great because they are twins but they are individual and celebrate different birthdays,' their proud dad said . Sometimes Xavier gets jealous of his brother's bronze skin. 'We went out fishing in the boat the other day and Xavier and I had to put sunscreen on while Jayden just lay there with his shirt off getting tanned without any sunblock,' he said. According to their father, the boys have contrasting personalties but do have a strong twin bond. 'They are best friends and always will be,' he said. 'Xavier has a very dry sense of humour whereas Jayden is more outgoing and takes the lead as the older boy,' he said. 'Whenever I'm away for work he will always be responsible and make sure the house is locked up whereas Xavier is carefree and relaxed.' Xavier (left) gets jealous of his brother's bronze skin because he doesn't have to wear sunscreen - pictured with their mum Helen Castles and her father Pat Castles . The boys are in different classes so Xavier (right) doesn't ride on the coat tails of his older brother by a day . Lucy and Maria Aylmer, 18, from Gloucester are non-identical twins . Their story comes after a pair of 18-year-old girls, from Gloucester, who were born with radically different colouring thanks to mixed-race parentage, revealed how they constantly have to explain their looks to curious strangers. Lucy and Maria Aylmer, who looks completely different  told ITV's Good Morning Britain that their classmates did not believe them when they told them they were twins. Their mother Donna is half Jamaican and their father Vince is white, and in a genetic quirk, together they managed to produce one white twin and one black twin.
Summary target: 
    11-year-old Jayden and Xavier Boughey are twins with different looks .
Jayden has dark skin while Xavier was born with a white complexion .
They also have different birthdays, with Jayden being born after midnight .
Their mother is half Samoan and their father has Canadian heritage .
They just started a new school and the kids don't believe they are brothers .

    Obesity rates in South Los Angeles grew by 12 per cent over three years despite a much-hailed ban on new fast food restaurants, research had found. Before the dietary ordinance went into effect in 2008, 63 per cent of residents in the area reported being overweight or obese compared to 57 per cent in other parts of the county. But three years on, instead of the law curbing weight gain, the opposite trend took force. In 2011 75 percent of South Los Angeles residents reported being overweight or obese, while rates elsewhere only increased by one per cent. Obesity rates in South Los Angeles grew by 12per cent despite a much-hailed three-year ban on stand-alone fast-food restaurants, a new study has found . The failed fast food ruling targeted a 32-square-mile area south of Interstate 10 that struggles with high obesity rates and other health problems. The law, believed to be the first effort of its kind by a major city to improve public health, did not ban new eateries in strip malls. The research by the Rand Corp. think tank found that obesity rates in South Los Angeles continued to rise after passage of the law. 'It had no meaningful effect,' Rand senior economist Roland Sturm said. 'There's no evidence that diets have improved more in South Los Angeles. Obesity and overweight rates have not fallen.' Health experts said a single intervention would not reverse the obesity problem. People also have to exercise and make lifestyle changes, they said. Local problem: Before the dietary ordinance went into effect in 2008, 63per cent of residents in the area reported being overweight or obese compared to 57per cent in other parts of the county . 'It's not just about limiting unhealthy food, but increasing access to healthy food,' said Alex Ortega, a professor of public health at the University of California, Los Angeles, who had no role in the study. Rand researchers reviewed permits issued by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, which inspects food outlets. There were no licenses for stand-alone fast-food restaurants, but chains opened 17 new outlets in strip shopping centers and food courts in South Los Angeles from 2008 to 2012. Almost half of the new food permits were for convenience stores that sell soda and junk food, the study found. Researchers also compared obesity rates in South Los Angeles and other parts of the county using surveys that asked residents to report their weight and eating habits. Supporters said the ordinance worked because it prevented chains from opening new restaurants at major intersections with their own drive-thru windows and parking lots. They acknowledged it will take some time to see health gains but noted that the area has seen farmers markets and community gardens in recent years. 'We never said this ordinance was the silver bullet' to solving the obesity problem, said Gwen Flynn of the Community Health Councils. Unhappy: Standing outside a McDonald's in the Leimert Park neighborhood on Wednesday, Edward Cox lamented the lack of sidewalk cafes - he wasn't a fan of the fast food ban . Changing tastes: Maurice Thrower, who runs a burger joint sandwiched between fast-food chains, said he offers healthier fare such as vegetarian and turkey burgers . 'As long as we can make sure people have more options, that's the important thing.' City Councilman Bernard Parks, who supported the zoning law, said he was hopeful that the area can attract more markets selling fresh food. The ordinance was opposed by the California Restaurant Association. Spokeswoman Janna Haynes said the group had no comment on the Rand study. Standing outside a McDonald's in the Leimert Park neighborhood on Wednesday, Edward Cox lamented the lack of sidewalk cafes. 'I want to sit down and eat, but there's no place to sit down and eat,' said the retiree, who usually drives to another neighborhood to dine out. Cox said he's hopeful that a planned light rail line will attract a variety of new eateries. Maurice Thrower, who runs a burger joint sandwiched between fast-food chains, said he offers healthier fare such as vegetarian and turkey burgers. 'Once people stop to eat here, they come back,' said Thrower, who opened Simply Delicious Burgers last year.

    Harrison Ford may have been survived Thursday's plane crash without life-threatening injury, but the actor's distraught wife is now urging him to take the hint and stay grounded permanently after his lucky escape. Ford has a passion for flying, but wife of five years, Calista Flockhart, 50, is strongly urging her 72-year-old husband that now is the time to call it quits because he might not be so fortunate next time. Ford suffered multiple injuries, including a fractured pelvis and broken ankle, when he crash landed his 1940s aircraft onto a Californian golf course, but he is expected to make a full recovery. Calista Flochart, 50, was pictured on Sunday on her way to UCLA hospital looking relieved and almost smiling as it emerged that Ford could be out as early as next week . The Ally McBeal star is strongly urging her 72-year-old husband Harrison Ford that now is the time to call it quits as a pilot after his lucky escape from a plane crash last Thursday . The Star Wars-star has a passion for flying his prized collection of planes . 'Calista is devastated. Thank goodness Harrison is OK but it could have been much, much worse,' a friend of the actress told The Mirror. 'It is a worry for her and his children that he has this dangerous hobby. 'Whether or not he will pilot a plane again remains to be seen but everyone around him certainly hopes he will take a break – or give it up for ever. It is ­obviously a huge worry.' The Ally McBeal star was pictured on Sunday on her way to UCLA hospital looking relieved and almost smiling as it emerged that Ford could be out as early as next week. Flockhart isn't the only one voicing her concerns for the screen legend, Star Wars co-star Carrie Fisher has also urged him to 'take a break' following his plane crash and take it easy. Bloodied: Harrison Ford is carried away from the scene of his plane crash on Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles on Thursday . Wreckage: Harrison Ford is believed to have suffered a pelvic fracture, ankle injuries, and multiple bruises and cuts after crashing his vintage single-engine plane . Addressing Harrison, she told PEOPLE magazine: 'I know you have incredible bounce back, please take a bounce break for awhile. Can I drive next time?' Fisher, who plays Princess Leia in the films, told The Mail on Sunday that she had a car smash in Los Angeles last Sunday – and now fears that one of her other co-stars will also suffer an accident. 'Things happen in threes,' she said. 'I'm about to call Mark Hamill [who plays Luke Skywalker] to make sure he's OK. I have a horrid feeling there's a curse going on here.' Ford, 72, remained in hospital last night after crashing his vintage single-engine plane on Thursday. It is believed he suffered a pelvic fracture, ankle injuries, and multiple bruises and cuts. The superstar was hailed as a hero for avoiding a densely populated area of Los Angeles after the engine failed. He brought the plane down on a golf course. Fisher, 58, met Ford when they starred in the original Star Wars film in 1977, in which he played daredevil Han Solo. Young guns: Harrison Ford (left), Carrie Fisher (Centre) and Mark Hamill (right) in 1977's Star Wars . Fisher (pictured), who plays Princess Leia in the films, has revealed that she was in a car smash in Los Angeles last Sunday . They have remained close friends and appear in the next instalment of the franchise. It was filmed in the UK last summer and is due for release in December. Fisher, who is known for her eccentric views on life, said: 'What is funny is that last Sunday it was raining hard in LA. I was driving to the art store and I got into an accident. 'It wasn't that serious and I wasn't hurt but it's the first car accident I've ever had. I drove home and that's when the wheel came off my BMW. My assistant told me I could have died if the wheel had come off when I was on the freeway.' Laughing, she added: 'Then I was watching the news and saw Harrison had his crash. 'I'm a bit worried it's the curse of Star Wars. 'The thing about Harrison is that he's always the coolest dude in the room. He just oozes manly manliness. I'm not surprised he landed the plane in one piece and survived.' Fisher has not spoken to Ford since the crash, but has sent him some beer. She explained that on one occasion they were planning to fly together. 'I was messing around and he said, 'Look, do you want to fly or can we have a beer?' 'He wouldn't have a drink if we were going to fly. It became something of a joke between us that I chose to have a beer that time rather than fly. I sent him some beers to the hospital with the message, 'You should have had a beer this time.' She added: 'He's primal. As a woman you feel safe with him. I fully expect he will be back up there soon – even if he's told he's not allowed to. Harrison isn't someone who follows the normal rules.' According to the Los Angeles Times, Ford is 'uninsurable'. In 1999 the father of five crashed his helicopter in the desert north of Los Angeles after the motor failed. A year later he was forced to crash-land a plane in Nebraska. Fisher said Ford's accident last summer on the set of Star Wars VII – when the door of the Millennium Falcon dropped on to his leg, shattering it – was 'more serious than was let on'. She added: 'It could have been billions of times worse.'

    (CNN)As a controversy over a racist video continues, the University of Oklahoma is announcing a plan to hire a vice president who will oversee diversity programs. A video of a racist chant by the university's now-disbanded Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity made headlines nationwide this week. It shows students on a bus clapping, pumping their fists and laughing as they chant, "There will never be a ni**** SAE. You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me. There will never be a ni**** SAE." In announcing the new position Wednesday night,  university President David Boren said he decided to make the hire two months ago --  before the video came to light -- and is in talks with an African-American candidate. The school newspaper and a student organization publicized the nine-second video clip after receiving it via anonymous messages. Shortly after it surfaced, the university cut ties with Sigma Alpha Epsilon, as did the national fraternity. Two students spotted in the video, Parker Rice and Levi Pettit, have been expelled for their alleged leadership role in the chant. "I am deeply sorry for what I did Saturday night. It was wrong and reckless," Rice said Tuesday in a statement to The Dallas Morning News. "I made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same." A statement from Pettit's parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to African-Americans, students and university faculty. "He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting. While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist," Brody and Susan Pettit said. CNN has reached out to both students. A spokesman for the Pettit family confirmed that Levi Pettit was in the video but declined CNN's request for an interview. Boren has ordered a shutdown of the fraternity house in Norman, and said it was no longer affiliated with the university. "Livid, just extremely heartbroken," Jay Vinekar, a founder of the university's SAE chapter, told CNN affiliate KTRK . "I don't want it in my house, and I don't want those people to wear my letters, claiming to represent me. The problem is not just a couple of guys on that bus, the problem is that house, it's a cancer that needs to be cut out." Local SAE alumni apologized on behalf of other members, saying the fraternity has had problems for years. "The OU SAE Board of Trustees has discovered that a horrible cancer entered into the OU chapter of SAE three to four years ago, and was not immediately and totally stopped," the organization said in a statement Wednesday. "It should have been." The fraternity said it is investigating other incidents involving other chapters that were brought to the attention of its national office. It's unclear whether more students will be punished for the video. Boren has said the fraternity won't return during his tenure if he can help it. CNN's Alina Machado, Tristan Smith and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

    Israeli police say they have shot a man suspected of carrying out a terror attack that left at least five female officers suffering serious injuries this morning. The suspect  is believed to have driven a car in to a crowd of female police officers who were standing outside a border police station between the line separating the east of the city from the west. Photographs on social media suggest the suspect was left with serious injuries after being shot by officers who moved to incapacitate him when he got out of his vehicle and began attacking onlookers with a meat cleaver. There has not yet been an official confirmation of the man's condition. Down: Photographs on social media suggest the suspect (pictured on the ground) was injured after being shot by officers who moved to incapacitate him when he got out of his car began attacking passers-by . Crash: The suspect is believed to have driven a car in to a crowd of female police officers who were standing outside a border police station between the line separating the east of the city from the west . Israeli medics and a policeman evacuate an injured person from the scene of the Jerusalem attack . The attack took place at a border police station on Shimon Ha'Tsadik Street, which marks the line between east and west Jerusalem, according to Micky Rosenfeld, a spokesman for the local force. The suspect is believed to be a Arab man in his early 30s who hails from east Jerusalem. Paramedics said they administered first aid to at least five people, all female police officers. Three of the women are in a serious condition, while the other two escaped with only minor injuries. Witnesses on the ground claimed that after ploughing his car into the officers, the man got out the vehicle and attacked Israeli onlookers with a knife, although that report has not been confirmed. The same border police station was subject to a hit and run attack in November that killed one police officer and left 13 other people suffering serious injuries. An Israeli policeman and medics evacuate an injured person at the scene of this morning's Jerusalem attack . After ploughing in to the female officers the attacker is understood to have crashed into a cyclist . 'The incident was apparently a deliberate attack,' police spokeswoman Luba Samri said, adding that the driver had been taken to hospital in a serious condition. The incident took place on the Jewish holiday of Purim, when the streets are busy with pedestrians. Last October and November, there was a spate of similar attacks, with Palestinian drivers ramming their vehicles into people waiting at the city's light-rail stops. Those attacks killed three people and wounded around a dozen. Tensions flared in Jerusalem last year, both before and after the Gaza war, but the city has been relatively calm in recent months. On Thursday, the Palestine Liberation Organization agreed to suspend security coordination with Israel in the occupied West Bank, which officials are concerned could have a knock-on impact on security throughout the territory. The Palestinians seek a state in the West Bank and East Jerusalem -- which have been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war -- and in Gaza, a strip of land on the Mediterranean coast that is separated from the West Bank. An Israeli police officer stands at the scene of an of this morning's attack in Jerusalem . Chaos: The suspect is believed to have driven a car in to a crowd of female police officers who were standing outside a border police station between the line separating the east of the city from the west . The attack comes just one week after the Mayor of Jerusalem Nir Barkat instructed his bodyguards to apprehend a Palestinian man who had just stabbed an ultra-Orthodox Jew in the stomach in the middle of a busy street. Mr Barkat said he and his staff were travelling in a car when he noticed the 'terrorist' with a knife. He and his bodyguard leaped from their car to stop the attacker. The bodyguard drew his firearm and wrestled the 18-year-old attacker to the ground and held him until police arrived. The 27-year-old victim suffered a stab wound to the stomach and was only 'lightly injured' according to police.

    (CNN)How do Republicans try to breathe new life into an old scandal? We've seen it time and time again. Here's how it works: . Step One: Republicans, with nothing in their arsenal to use against Hillary Clinton, selectively leak to reporters a "scandalous" tidbit -- often one that has been previously reported. Step Two: The new media bites. Step Three: The media hyperventilates and suffocates the airwaves with repetition of the same story. Step Four: Upon further examination, the story falls apart. This is exactly how the latest media hype, this time over Hillary Clinton's use of emails at the State Department, has played out. And it presents yet another chapter in the Benghazi hoax. The New York Times story about Hillary Clinton's use of a private email account at the State Department is a perfect example of "gotcha" journalism, where reporters will take any bait the Republicans give them without proper vetting. The New York Times has a history of this. (Whitewater, anyone?) The Times story suggests Secretary Clinton broke federal rules in relation to her email. But the Times' main source for this allegation says Clinton violated no laws. Yes, Clinton used a private email account to communicate while she was secretary of state. But so did secretaries of state before her. According to the State Department spokesman Marie Harf, John Kerry is the first secretary of state ever to rely primarily on official State Department email. Clinton asks State to release emails: What you need to know . In October 2014, 18 months after Clinton left, the State Department was engaged in the process of updating its records preservation policies.  The State Department asked every secretary of state dating back to Madeleine Albright to provide records, including emails, from their time in office. Clinton responded to the State Department's request for emails, providing the department with over 55,000 pages of emails. She did so months ago. Clinton has been fully transparent and has asked the State Department for these emails to be made public. Republican investigators seeking to hype the current Benghazi investigation leaked the issue to keep a dying investigation alive. And once again, reporters bit. In the days since The New York Times posted its story, there have been dozens and dozens of stories written on the topic. Why? Because the Clintons are held to a double standard when it comes to media scrutiny. Their perfectly usual, above board behavior is spun as secretive and unaccountable -- while Republicans are left relatively unscathed. Mitt Romney used his private email account to discuss political business, and when he left the governor's office, his administration destroyed records rather than turn them over to state archives. Scott Walker's County Executive's office used a secret email system, which investigators determined was being used to engage in campaign work on county time and to avoid public records disclosure laws. Mike Huckabee's office had files, including emails, cleaned and physically destroyed, including "travel records, calendars, call logs, and emails." Why hasn't their behavior been scrutinized over and over again? Because their last name isn't Clinton. In the end, all we are left with is the benign fact that Hillary Clinton used a personal email account at the State Department. This isn't even a revelation -- it has been known for years. Looks like the Republicans wasted their breath, once again, for nothing.
Summary target: 
    David Brock: The story is another example of GOP efforts to create a phony controversy .
Hillary Clinton's email practices didn't break the law, he says .
Summarized text: 
    Hillary Clinton's use of a private email account at the State Department is a "gotcha" story, says Mark Osler. The New York Times has dozens and hundreds on the topic since it was first published in October 2014 - but no laws enacted by the Republican Party — or did they?

Outside his door stands 'The Assistant', a monitor showing a . woman's face that can converse with visitors, has access to . Horvitz's calendar and can book meetings. On his desktop, Horvitz runs 'Lifebrowser', a program that . stores everything from appointments to photos and uses machine . learning to identify the important moments.

Apple is also pushing Siri, which uses Microsoft's Bingsearch engine in the background, into new areas with its CarPlayand HomeKit platforms, as well as the recently unveiled AppleWatch.

    The full extent of the impact of good schools on house prices around England is laid bare by research released today. A map produced by Savills estate agents shows the cost of homes near the best performing schools can be more than 25% higher than in other areas. Each dot on the map represents a school, with the darker coloured dots representing better performing schools and the size of the dot showing the 'house price premium' around that school. Scroll down for video . The fact that the darker dots are often the largest in each area shows just how much parents are willing to pay to live near a good school. Savills say the map shows that certain areas can be classed as 'educational hotspots', in which a choice of good schools leads to a spike in property prices. The company say the best examples of these are Northwood in Middlesex, Brighton in West Sussex, Shrewsbury in Shropshire and Ascot in Berkshire. The map also shows how selective grammar schools, such those in Kent and Buckinghamshire, drive up house prices in the surrounding area. Lucian Cook, director of residential research at Savills, said: 'What it shows is there are clear house price premiums around high performing state schools. These are not uniform, there are exceptions where people can still get access to a well-performing school, but generally, there is a premium. 'That said, I suppose there is a bit of a chicken and an egg situation of where you have to ask whether affluent families cluster around a high performing school, or are schools high performing because of the families who live nearby.' A graph produced by estate agents shows that house prices are higher than the regional average in places where pupils perform well at school . The report states: 'For many [house buyers], rather than pinning their hope on a single school, a choice of good schools will determine whether they will look to buy. 'In locations such as Northwood, Brighton, Shrewsbury and Ascot that will be driven entirely by a cluster of high performing independent schools. 'In others such as Dorking, Malvern, Borehamwood, Warwick, Oxford and Guildford these will be supplemented by one or two high performing state school alternatives. 'In other areas, such as Wallington, Altrincham, Orpington it might be exclusively a function of the grammar school system. 'In others, such as Bath Winchester, York, Colchester, Tunbridge Wells, Chelmsford and Cambridge the a network of a range of high performing schools underpins a high value family housing market.' The research comes after a study last year found a top state secondary adds an average of £21,000 to surrounding house prices - with one school in Buckinghamshire adding nearly £500,000 to the price of nearby homes. The research shows how parents are willing to pay much more in order to live close to a good school .

    Research by estate agents shows house prices in areas with good schools are up to 28% more than local average .

    New research funded by farmers aims to breed a wheat variety for people who can't eat the  grain, an endeavor that comes as wider consumer interest in gluten-free foods is booming. The Kansas Wheat Commission is spending $200,000 for the first two years of the project, which is meant to identify everything in wheat's DNA sequences that can trigger a reaction in people suffering from celiac disease. The disease is an autoimmune disorder in which eating even tiny amounts of gluten - made up of numerous, complex proteins that gives dough its elasticity and some flavor to baked goods - can damage the small intestine. Chris Miller, senior director of research for Engrain, a Kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry, said funding research to breed gluten-free wheat is 'the right thing to do' The only known treatment known is a gluten-free diet, which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat, rye and barley. Though celiac disease is four-to-five times more common now than 50 years ago, only about one per cent of the world's population is believed to suffer from it, and just a fraction have been diagnosed. But the gluten-free food business has skyrocketed in the last five years, driven in part by non-celiac sufferers who are either intolerant to gluten or following a gluten-free fad diet because they believe it may help them lose weight or that it's somehow healthier. Sales of gluten-free snacks, crackers, pasta, bread and other products reached $973million in the United States in 2014, up from $810million the previous year, according to a January report by consumer research firm Packaged Facts. The research analyzed the sales of hundreds of explicitly labeled and marketed gluten-free products and brands at supermarkets, drugstores, and mass merchandisers. Supporters of the Kansas research, though, say this isn't a way to regain market share. Miller shows a flour solution from a specific strain of wheat at a research facility in the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas. The only known treatment for celiac desiseas is a gluten-free diet, which consists of not eating foods that contain wheat, rye and barley . The research for gluten-free wheat began in July at the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas. It is still in its early stages and researchers are looking at proteins inside the grain . 'If you know you are producing a crop that is not tolerated well by people, then it's the right thing to do,' according to the project's lead researcher, Chris Miller, senior director of research for Engrain, a Kansas company that makes products to enhance the nutrition and appearance of products made by the milling and cereal industry. Gluten-free foods are a niche product, and in the broader context of the world's wheat markets, it is not a driving factor, according to Dan O'Brien, extension grain market specialist at Kansas State University. 'I anticipate it will develop as a specialty market,' Miller said.The research, which began in July at the Wheat Innovation Center in Manhattan, Kansas, is still in its early stages, with researchers extracting proteins from seeds of various varieties of wheat. Miller has yet to begin work combining the proteins with antibodies produced by the human immune system to test for reactions. He also plans to examine the wild relatives of wheat as well as modern varieties, and will tap into a Kansas wheat variety repository that dates back to the 1900s in hopes of finding a variety - perhaps one that fell out of favor among commercial farmers - that might already be low in reactivity for celiac sufferers. Researchers hope to use that variety to develop a gluten-free wheat using traditional breeding methods. Miller's methodology might be 'too simplistic an approach' that wouldn't identify all the toxic sequences that trigger a celiac reaction, according to Armin Alaedini, assistant professor of medical sciences at Columbia University and a researcher at the New York-based school's Celiac Disease Center. Miller (pictured) plans to look at wild relatives of wheat as well as modern grains. Researchers hope to use these varieties and traditional breeding methods to develop a gluten-free wheat . Alaedini, after looking at Miller's plan online, said the project may end up with a less toxic wheat product that isn't completely safe for all celiac disease patients. 'After all this effort, this product that is coming out... is unlikely to be superior in terms of nutritional value or baking properties and taste to the gluten-free products that are already on the market,' Alaedini said. The medical advisory board for the Celiac Disease Foundation, a nonprofit based in Woodland Hills, California, could not reach a consensus on the viability of Miller's research. But the organization's CEO, Marilyn Geller, is encouraged. Her son had been sick his entire life before being diagnosed with celiac disease at age 15, Geller said, and his father also was later diagnosed. Since the disorder is genetic, her grandchildren will be at risk of getting it. The more the disease is in the public eye, the more physicians are aware of it, she said, and it'll be more likely the federal government would fund research. 'I am certain that there are a large number of people with celiac disease who (like) the idea of being able to eat actual wheat, with the properties of wheat that make the bread nice and fluffy,' she said. 'The idea of having a variety of wheat that they could eat that has those wonderful wheat-like properties would certainly be very interesting for them.' Sales of gluten-free products in the United States increaed last year, reaching $973million in 2014, up from $810million in 2013 .

    Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew is promising an exciting summer of recruitment at Selhurst Park after the club effectively guaranteed their Premier League survival with a comeback victory at Stoke City. Palace are now 11 points clear of the drop zone and Pardew can think about building for next season, buoyed by the new Sky Sports TV deal and a possible takeover from American businessman Josh Harris. Recruitment is now uppermost in Pardew’s mind and he revealed: ‘We are getting calls regarding players from Inter Milan and Benfica because they are our market now. Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace came from behind to beat Stoke 2-1 at the Britannia Stadium . Pardew (left) congratulates wing wizard Yannick Bolasie at full-time after Palace's impressive victory . Wilfried Zaha has scored in his last two games against QPR and Stoke, the first time he’s netted consecutively since October 2012 in his first spell with Palace . ‘Palace now come into the same group as everybody below the likes of Everton, Tottenham and Liverpool, and the most important thing is to try to trade well. ‘It’s important to preserve your Premier League status early. If you leave it late, it is very difficult to get players. You don’t want other teams putting packages together and working on players before you can. ‘We are pretty secure in approaching clubs and players now as a Premier League side for next season and that’s what we will do. We have the finance to do what we say we are going to do. So it does give us a slight advantage.’ One player who will remain is reborn winger Wilfried Zaha who scored the winner at The Britannia for his first back-to-back goals since 2012. In February, Wilfried Zaha (right) was sad, but according to Alan Pardew he is now playing with a smile . Zaha signed for Manchester United after Palace's promotion, but his career nosedived at Old Trafford . Zaha’s career nosedived after a £15million move to Manchester United went sour and he has gone from being capped by England to not even making the Under 21 squad. He was ordered to smile more and sulk less by Pardew last week and celebrated his goal at Stoke by playfully sticking out his tongue. ‘He looked a sad player when I arrived (from Newcastle in January),’ said Pardew. ‘You are never going to play your best football when you're sad and sometimes good management is not about tactics but inspiring players. He was down in the dumps for whatever reason. ‘Young players need that exuberance, particularly with the way he plays. And smiling and being happy is part of that exuberance.’ Nonetheless, 22-year-old Zaha doesn’t plan on transforming himself into a cartoon clown. ‘I do smile when I need to!,’ he stressed. Crystal Palace players celebrate with Glenn Murray after he scored a penalty to draw Palace level . Stoke manager Mark Hughes was distraught with two key decisions by referee Andre Marriner . ‘When it is time to be serious, I’m serious. When it is time to play around I will play around. ‘We’ve got the points we’ve needed to now so we can play without pressure and enjoy the rest of the season.’ There wasn’t much hilarity from beaten Stoke manager Mark Hughes who felt his side were robbed by two key decisions from referee Andre Marriner after taking a 14th-minute lead from Mame Diouf. Hughes has joined West Brom manager Tony Pulis in saying technology should be brought in immediately to stop the wrong decisions being made. The Stoke boss was furious that Mr Marriner awarded Palace a penalty when Asmir Begovic and Yannick Bolasie collided and Glenn Murray levelled from the spot. And after Zaha had put Palace ahead, the official waved away a strong appeal for handball against Palace defender Joel Ward. Hughes believes that Palace defender Joel Ward (right) was guilty of handball in the penalty area . Hughes slammed the standard of refereeing in the Premier League this season . Hughes said: ‘It was clear to everybody that he has thrown his body, his arms to stop the ball going goalwards. It was a shot on target, he was not close to the ball, he was about five yards away so it was a clear penalty. ‘I don’t think the standard of refereeing this year has been as good as it needs to be. They need a little bit of help and I’m an advocate of TV replays. ‘I think it is quite simple. If a big decision is made, he needs to ask the question: is there any reason why I should not give a penalty, or why I should not give a goal. Within 10 or 15 seconds they can give the referee an answer and there will be more correct decisions. They need to be given that option because at the moment they need a lot more help. ‘I think we have reached a tipping point. Before there were debates one way or the other but now I think it needs to come in.’

    Vietnamese Quoc Ta, 33, (pictured) had been deported from the UK twice before he was arrested  at Derby train station carrying £4,500 of cannabis . An illegal immigrant who had twice been deported from Britain was caught with 2.2lb of cannabis on a train - after sneaking back into the UK for a third time. Quoc Ta was jailed for eight months after a court heard how transport police officers boarded a carriage and noticed an overwhelming stench of cannabis. Local councillors yesterday said the case proves that Britain remains an ‘easy touch’ for foreign criminals despite Border Force attempts to claim down on the influx of offenders from abroad. Ta, from Vietnam, now faces being deported for a third time once he is released from prison after being caught with cannabis with a street value of up to £4,500 while sitting alone on the train at Derby station. The 33-year-old admitted possessing the class B drug with intent to supply. Ta first came to the attention of UK authorities in 2008 when he was arrested in connection with a burglary. He was not convicted but was deported to Vietnam. He was arrested in April 2012 after being recruited as a ‘gardener’ growing cannabis for a south-east Asian gang and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. On his release he was deported in December 2012. Derby Crown Court was not told how Ta made it back into the country for a third time, but prosecutor Karen Davenport-Coles said he was arrested in January when British Transport Police went on to the train where there was an ‘extremely strong smell of cannabis’. Laura Chaplin, defending, said, told the court on Monday that Ta, of Leeds, returned to the UK for a third time having been ‘the victim of a very serious assault in Vietnam, through owing money.’ She said a knife had been used in the attack and threats had been made against his family. Miss Chaplin said Ta had agreed to transport the cannabis for payment after finding himself ‘in a very desperate situation.’ Following the hearing, Councillor Alan Graves, leader of Derby’s UKIP group said: ‘Clearly, he’s not the sort of person we want in this country. I would imagine once he got into an EU country, he found it very easy to get back into this country. ‘He obviously wants to come to this country because we are an easy touch.’ Fellow councillor Lucy Care, deputy leader of Derby’s Liberal Democrats, said: ‘It doesn’t seem right to me that somebody that we’ve sent out of the country because he is not following our laws is able to get back in again so soon afterwards. It makes a mockery of having gone to the effort to get rid of him.’ A Home Office spokesman said all passengers entering the UK were ‘checked against police, security and immigration watch lists on arrival.’ He added: ‘Where we believe someone poses a risk, Border Force officers can - and do - refuse them entry. ‘Border Force officers use an array of search techniques including sniffer dogs, carbon dioxide detectors, heartbeat monitors, scanners and visual searches to find well-hidden stowaways on vehicles. Ta was arrested in January when British Transport Police went on to the train where there was an ‘extremely strong smell of cannabis’. He was arrested in April 2012 after being recruited as a ‘gardener’ growing cannabis . ‘Those subject to deportation orders face an indefinite ban from returning to the UK. They are entitled to apply to have the ban lifted after 10 years.’ Last August, a court heard how a Lithuanian burglar who was deported upon early release from prison was caught back in the UK just 12 days later. Police suspected Marius Siurkus, 32, returned to Peterborough to retrieve jewellery he had stolen during the burglary and hidden under floorboards. Incredibly, Siurkus’s accomplice in the burglary, countryman Mantas Pronckus, had also twice previously been freed from prison early and deported - only to return to the UK and continue offending on each occasion. The same month, 14-year-old Alice Gross disappeared after going for a walk along a canal near her home in Brentford, west London. The teenager’s body was later recovered from the River Brent. The badly decomposed body of the prime suspect in the murder, Arnis Zalkalns, 41, was found in a park one mile away in October, after it had been revealed the Latvian had been allowed into the UK despite being convicted of murder in his homeland. Foreign criminals make up about one in eight - or 11,000 - of all those behind bars in England and Wales.

    (CNN)The terror that came to Tunisia on Wednesday -- the deadliest attack on tourists in the Arab world since the 1997 massacre in Luxor, Egypt -- was a long time coming. Tunisia has been widely seen as the only success story of the Arab Spring with a new progressive constitution, a freely elected secular President and Prime Minister, and a moderate Islamist opposition so far committed to democratic principles. But economic progress has lagged well behind. High unemployment has created frustrations among the young and a significant number have looked for answers in radical Islam. Political opening in Tunisia has given radicals more breathing room, their numbers swollen by the release hardened Islamist militants during the 2011 Tunisian revolution that swept away decades of autocratic rule. One of those who was freed from jail was Seifallah ben Hassine -- also known as Abu Iyyad -- a veteran Tunisian Jihadi who worked with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan in the 1990s and founded the Tunisian Combatant group. Soon after he was released he founded Ansar al Shariah in Tunisia, a pro-Jihadi movement which has up to 40,000 followers. The group has a similar outlook to its namesake in Libya which the United States says carried out the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, and according to Geoff Porter, a terrorism expert at North Africa Risk Consulting, there are real and fluid links between the two groups. Three days after the Beghazi attack, Ansar al Shariah in Tunisia organized a mob attack outside the U.S. Embassy in Tunisia which put American lives at risk. According to the U.S. government, the group has also been responsible for several other attacks, including attempted suicide bombings at Tunisian tourist destinations. In October 2013, a Tunisian suicide bomber blew himself up outside a beach hotel in Sousse, killing only himself. Another was arrested in Monastir before he could blow up his device. The two had reportedly tried to travel to Syria but had been persuaded enroute by Jihadis in Libya to bring Jihad home. In 2013 two secular Tunisian politicians were assassinated by Islamist extremists.  The United States said Ansar al Shariah was implicated in the attacks. In the last two years, Tunisian security forces have increasingly cracked down on Ansar al Shariah, but the movement still has a significant following. Ben Hassine fled to Libya where he is now believed to be based. The Syrian Jihad has been the single biggest factor in the worsening security situation in Tunisia. Over 3000 Tunisians have flocked to fight Jihad in Syria and Iraq, many of them joining ISIS. And about 500 are believed to have returned stretching the resources of security services. In December 2014 ISIS released a video calling on Tunisians to pledge allegiance to ISIS and carry out attacks, including assassinations. The Tunis museum attack took place just days after a Tunisian Jihadi tweeted that a pledge of allegiance by Tunisian Jihadis to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was coming soon, according to the SITE intelligence group. The Tunisian Jihadi who posted the message Sunday claimed to belong to "Jund al-Khilafah in Tunisia." In December, a grouping by the same name had pledged allegiance to ISIS. But the earlier pledge appears not to have fully registered with ISIS.  An ISIS fighter in Raqqah, recently appeared in a video questioning why Jihadis in Tunisia had not pledged fealty. The Tunisian Jihadi replied "Wait for the glad tidings of what will bring you joy. ... The delay of the public pledge of allegiance was for the sake of preparation." The statement raises the possibility that the museum attack could be ISIS's debut on the Tunisian stage, timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from Tunisian Jihadis for maximum impact. While pro-ISIS twitter accounts lit up in celebration after the museum attack, there had been no credible claims of responsibility as of late Wednesday. Tunisian security officials are worried about spillover from an increasingly chaotic Libya.  ISIS has taken advantage of a simmering civil war in Tunisia's neighbor to rapidly expand. It is now the dominant force in Derna in eastern Libya and controls parts of the town center of Sirte, the hometown of former Libya strongman Moammar Gadhafi. And it has built an increasingly significant presence in Tripoli itself, carrying out a gun attack on the Corinthia Hotel in January. A number of Tunisians are also believed to be training with ISIS in a half dozen training camps the group operates in the Green Mountains between Benghazi and Derna in eastern Libya. In late 2012 al Qaeda's North African affiliate AQIM set up a branch in Tunisia called the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade, a 60-strong Jihadi outfit composed of Tunisians, Algerians, and some Libyans. The group is believed to include fighters driven out of Mali by French forces. The Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade has been responsible for a string of attacks on Tunisian security services in mountainous Djebel Chaambi region along the Algerian border. "They have been the most active terrorist organization in Tunisia to date," Porter told CNN. "It is rumored, but not confirmed, that they are getting additional personnel from Algeria because members of AQIM in Algeria have been fleeing intensified Algerian military operations." Andrew Lebovich, a North Africa security analyst based in New York told CNN that the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade issued a statement late last year threatening to attack Tunis. "Most of their attacks have been in the Djebel Chaambi region but it's possible they have extended their operations closer to the capital," he said. The museum attack is the biggest crisis faced by Tunisia since the revolution. It is likely to significantly impact Tunisia's tourism industry, worsening the economic outlook and increasing the sense of frustration on which extremists thrive. There is also concern Tunisian security forces, traumatized by the attack on the capital, could once again embrace repression in their struggle to contain the Jihadi threat. "The Parliament was debating tougher anti-terrorism laws when the museum attack took place. The worry now is that Tunisia's security services will crack down hard on Islamists increasing tensions and making the problem far worse," Lebovich told CNN.

    Astronaut Scott Kelly's identical twin pulled a fast one on NASA right before his brother blasted off on a one-year space station mission by showing up at the launch without his usual mustache. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden told Scott Kelly, who was heading into space, on Monday that he almost had a heart attack when his brother, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, showed up at the launch. 'He fooled all of us,' Bolden said. Mark Kelly's mustache was 'the only way I can tell you two apart', he told Scott. Scroll down for video . Spot the difference: Mark Kelly (left) is a retired astronaut while his identical twin brother, Scott Kelly (right), just left for another space mission and will be spending nearly a year in the International Space Station . While Scott (right) is in space, doctors will be studying him and Mark (left) to see how being in space affects the body and behaviors . Mustache-less Mark Kelly (bottom) had a chance to speak with the astronauts (top), including his brother Scott (top left) once they got to the International Space Station. Mark, a former space shuttle commander, was still clean shaven as of Monday afternoon, as he chatted with Bolden about the unprecedented medical experiments planned on the twins over the coming year. Doctors want to see how the space twin's body compares with his genetic double on the ground. In a series of ten investigations, doctors will look at the subtle differences that could occur between the brother on earth and the brother in space. Experiments will look at physiology, shifts in behavior, decision making and alertness, according to People. Scott Kelly arrived at the International Space Station on Friday night following a launch from Kazakhstan. He will remain on board for 342 days, until next March, with Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko. Mark (left), known for his mustache as a distinguishing factor between him and his brother, visited the space launch the day Scott (right) departed after shaving off his facial hair to fool NASA staff . It will be NASA's longest spaceflight ever. 'It's like coming to my old home,' said Kelly, who spent five months at the space station in 2010-2011. The White House sent congratulations to the astronauts on Monday. President Barack Obama's science adviser, John Holdren, wished Kelly, Kornienko and the rest of the crew the best of luck and noted that the yearlong mission is an important milestone on the path to sending humans to Mars in the mid-2030s. 'You guys are all heroes up there, and we're depending on you,' Holdren said in a phone hookup. Mark Kelly, meanwhile, paid tribute to the brothers' father, who stayed behind in Houston for last week's launch. Richard Kelly, a retired and widowed police officer, is the only parent to endure a child's rocket launch so many times - eight between the two. 'He's been a trouper,' Mark said. Since the men left for space, Mark had a chance to speak with the astronauts once they got to the International Space Station. In a Tweet he wrote, 'Got to talk to @StationCDRKelly & crewmates after they made it safely aboard the Space Station. Doing well so far!'

    (CNN)Israel has again voted for a national leader who acts as if he considers one-fifth of its country's citizens -- including me and my family -- to be an existential threat. We were born into the wrong tribe, so to speak. Campaign season shed light on the troubling reality in Israel -- that tribalism trumps democracy and ethnicity trumps citizenship. When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Arabs were "being bused to the polling station in droves," people around the world were justifiably horrified. And Monday, in response to the outrage, he apologized for his statement, offering that he knew his comments "offended members of the Israeli Arab community." But Netanyahu's policies speak much more loudly than his half-apology. And with him poised to serve a fourth term, many Palestinian citizens of Israel fear, with good reason, that his victory means it is open season for anti-Arab racism in the Knesset and in the streets. Israel's war on its Palestinian citizens is nothing new; our rights have been under attack for years (imagine a proposal that forced Jewish Americans to sign a "loyalty oath" to the United States as was proposed for Palestinians and other non-Jewish citizens of Israel). However, the majority's attempt to further entrench institutionalized racism and deny the rights of indigenous Palestinians has achieved frightening momentum. The controversial "Jewish Nation-State Bill" that previously floundered in the Knesset has been resurrected. The bill, if passed, would codify the principle of preserving a Jewish ethnic majority. There are versions of it that establish Hebrew as the sole official language and recognize Jewish religious law as a "source of inspiration for the Knesset." Even Israel's Supreme Court has come under attack in recent years for occasionally defending minority rights, which some view as a threat to the legal privileges afforded its Jewish citizens. In response, the government changed the Supreme Court's composition to tilt it further to the right. Today, the sole Arab Supreme Court justice, Salim Jubran, very often serves as a dissenting voice in judgments where the court favors legislation demeaning to Israel's Palestinian citizens. Opinion: How Obama handed Netanyahu victory . The 2011 Admissions Committees Law — upheld in 2014 by the more conservative  Supreme Court, which includes the first Israeli settler jurist — allows hundreds of localities in Israel to essentially reject applicants seeking to buy homes built on state land because the applicants are deemed "unsuitable."  The law caused an outcry among Palestinian citizens and human rights groups, who assert that it's simply a thinly disguised effort to discriminate against Israeli citizens on the basis of ethnicity. Simply put, the law enforces segregation within Israel, helping to keep Palestinian citizens out of Jewish communities. Attempts to marginalize Palestinian citizens of Israel also extend to the political sphere. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's successful push to raise the threshold required to win seats in the Knesset was a move designed to exclude Palestinian lawmakers. Ironically, that move backfired, prompting four Arab parties to create the Arab Joint List, whose members span a wide ideological spectrum. Despite their political differences, they were united by one important mission, and that was to defend the rights of Palestinians, whether they reside within Israel or in the occupied territories. The Joint List won 13 seats and took third place in the parliamentary election. While their unity and strong showing is encouraging in the face of Israeli efforts to divide and weaken the Palestinian community, the fact that they were forced to unite on the basis of ethnicity rather than ideology is a reflection of Israeli politics, which draws boundaries among its citizens on the basis of ethnicity and religion and openly participates in ugly, xenophobic electioneering. Opinion: Will Netanyahu win seal Iran deal? The Greek philosopher Aristotle once said that the essence of democracy is "to rule and be ruled in turn," but as Hassan Jabareen, head of Adalah: The Legal Center for Minority Rights in Israel, puts it, in Israel, "Arabs are always ruled and Arab citizens are always in the opposition, never in the coalition, no matter how many seats they win." It is very telling that Netanyahu could well form his coalition with Avigdor Lieberman, who called for beheading disloyal Arab citizens of Israel and whose party Yisrael Beiteinu only won six seats in the Knesset, and not with the Arab Joint List, which won more than twice as many seats and is calling for equality and an end to Israel's military occupation of Palestinian lands, which has lasted nearly half a century. If Netanyahu's re-election is an ill omen for the Palestinian citizens of Israel, it is even worse news for the 4.5 million Palestinians under occupation who are ruled by a state that denies them all rights. When Netanyahu said on the eve of the election that he would not allow the creation of a Palestinian state, he was making it clear that the occupation will continue as long as he remains in power. Opinion: The danger of Netanyahu's win . Renouncing Palestinian statehood rallied Netanyahu's base by reminding them of how much he has done to preserve and extend Israel's grip on its West Bank settlements, built in violation of international law and considered illegitimate by official U.S. policy going back decades. In fact, blocking the creation of a Palestinian state has been Netanyahu's life's work. Over the years, he has rhetorically "accepted" Palestinian statehood while continuing to steal the very land that would comprise a Palestinian state. The lip service he has paid to Palestinian statehood and his desire to return to the bankrupt "peace process" has provided him with a useful smokescreen behind which he continues to actively realize the vision he revealed in his recent political campaign when he ruled out a two-state solution -- a vision of a greater Israel where Palestinians live under apartheid rule, without a state and without equal rights . The policies that Israel's electorate has chosen are directly at odds with U.S. interests, not to mention American values. Citizens around the world, including in the United States, are increasingly frustrated with Israel's treatment of Palestinians and its role in helping to fuel armed conflict in the region, as demonstrated by its current effort to scuttle U.S.-Iran nuclear talks. Netanyahu is expecting to attempt to resume business as usual with Washington, offering occasional platitudes about peace in exchange for the freedom to deepen the occupation and strip away the rights of Israel's Palestinian citizens. Given what is at stake, it will be dangerous for America -- and for Israel -- if President Obama plays along.

    Rula Jebreal: Netanyahu showed his views during the closing days of the campaign .
She says he favors policies that deny Israel's Arab citizens equal rights .

    Jeremy Cohen: Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's comments on Arab voters were justifiably horrifying.

    An investigation into the 1959 plane crash that killed Buddy Holly and three others could now be reopened after a respected pilot brought forward new factors as to how the aircraft may have gone down. At the time of the crash, the Civil Aeronautics Board ruled the probable cause of the crash was error by the pilot, Roger Peterson, who took off from Mason City to Moorhead, Minnesota, in inclement weather, even though he was qualified. The chartered plane crashed in Iowa not long after takeoff, killing Holly, Peterson, and musicians Ritchie Valens and J.P. Richardson. Now L.J. Coon, an experienced pilot from New England, says a variety of other factors - such as weight and balance calculations, the rate of the plane's climb and descent, fuel gauge readings and the passenger-side rudder - should have been considered, according to The Globe Gazette. Wreck: On February 3, 1959, a light aircraft chartered by Buddy Holly crashed in Clear Lake, Iowa, killing the singer and three others aboard. An investigation into the reasons for the crash - ruled at the time to be pilot - could now be reopened, after a pilot petitioned for other factors to be considered . Fiery: The accident, known as 'The Day the Music Died', that occurred on February 3, 1959, killed rock and roll musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J. P. 'The Big Bopper' Richardson, as well as the pilot, Roger Peterson . Too young: Buddy Holly was only 22 when he died, with his career only lasting 18 months. He is still considered one of the best musicians of all time . Tragic: The body of one of the three famous rock 'n' roll singers killed in the crash of a single engine bonanza  lies a few feet from the wreckage of the plane on February 3, 1959, in Clear Lake, Iowa . The National Transportation Safety Board has agreed to consider reopening the investigation. Coon's motivation was to 'the heroic effort that took place in those 4.9 miles' by the pilot, Peterson, before the plane crashed. The plane had been in the air less than four minutes. Coon received a letter from the NTSB saying they had received his call for a reinvestigation. 'You have gotten our attention. Let us do our due diligence in order to give you a proper answer,' the letter stated. The NTSB will now determine whether or not the submission meets the requirements of a Petition for Reconsideration. History and many other people believe that Peterson was the direct cause of the February 3, 1959 crash. Killed: Buffy Holly, who was one of the most popular entertainers of the 1950's, died in a plane crash in 1959 . In memoriam: A giant pair of glasses marks the place where Buddy Holly died in Clear Lake, Iowa . Gary W. Moore, author of Hey Buddy, a book about Holly's life, told the Globe Gazaette that the Aeronautics Board got it right 56 years ago. 'I think that what (a new investigation) is going to find it is its pretty simple,' Moore said. 'The pilot was unqualified to fly in those conditions and he lost control of the airplane.' Holly, a rockabilly pioneer, was only 22-years-old when he died, with a career lasting 18 months. Despite such a short time, Rolling Stone in 2004 ranked Holly as number 13 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.

    Aldi is up to 30 per cent cheaper than the ‘big five’ supermarkets despite the fact they have been cutting prices on shopping basket essentials. The budget chain continues to undercut the giants on everything from fruit and vegetables to eggs and pasta, an independent study found. Aldi came out cheapest on a basket of 33 commonly bought items at a total of £42.15, a saving of almost £8 compared to the £50.11 charged by Asda. Tesco was next best at £53.97, then Morrisons on £54.29 and Waitrose at £59.98. An new study has found that Aldi, pictured, continues to undercut the big five supermarkets on everything from produce to eggs and pasta . The German retailer was a remarkable £18 – 29.9 per cent – cheaper than Sainsbury’s, which came in at £60.15 in the survey by The Grocer magazine. The figures suggest that families could comfortably save more than £1,000 a year by switching to a budget supermarket. The mainstream stores insist the figures are not a fair reflection of prices. However it is clear customers believe the discount chains really do make their money go further. Aldi’s sales are up 19.3 per cent on a year ago, giving it a market share of 5 per cent, which is almost on a par with Waitrose. The growth of Aldi and its rival Lidl has triggered the greatest change in shopping habits since the 1950s when the large supermarkets first arrived to push aside independent traders. Studies suggest their combination of low prices and awards for their upmarket ranges of food and drink has successfully attracted the ‘BMW classes’ to their no-frills outlets. The mainstream stores, which have lost millions of customers, have responded by slashing prices on high profile items such as milk and bread, which is hurting their finances. Tesco has issued a series of profit warnings and Morrisons last week announced trading profits have halved. Even Waitrose has been dragged into the price war and has just reported a 24 per cent fall in annual profits. Such has been the impact of price cuts that it is now cheaper to feed a family than a year ago, and CPI inflation is expected to show Britain is about to enter its first period of deflation since the 1960s. Research by retail analysts Him! has revealed a significant change in the type of people shopping at Aldi and Lidl. The proportion who are in the wealthiest AB demographic category is up from 12 per cent in 2013 to 31 per cent today. However, the low prices are part of a package which means service at the budget chains is often below what people have come to expect. The Grocer found Aldi came bottom in terms of store layout, clutter in the aisles and difficulty getting through the ‘illogical, frantic and cramped check-out’. Sainsbury’s said the figures in the study were skewed by the fact it covers only a small number of the many thousands of items it stocks. It said it was very easy to identify products that are around the same figure as Aldi, such as onions, cornflakes, jam and English butter. A spokesman said: ‘We don’t think this price comparison is fair. ‘It’s a very small selection of products that changes every week. It is a randomness that can’t ever really equal fairness. It also doesn’t match up with our internal data or external data sources. 'We have plenty of data like this which demonstrates that we have never been more competitive on price.’
Summary target:

    Manchester United's attacking woes have been highlighted once more as it has emerged that Tottenham striker Harry Kane has scored more goals than Louis van Gaal's entire attack this season. Kane has scored 26 goals in all competitions during the course of the current campaign. The Tottenham star has netted 16 Barclays Premier League goals thus far. Manchester United's attacking trio of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao have amassed 25 goals in all competitions during the same period. Harry Kane celebrates his second goal against QPR during his side's 2-1 victory at Loftus Road on Saturday . Kane's form has been the highlight of Tottenham's season so far . Harry Kane: 26 . Robin van Persie: 10 . Wayne Rooney: 11 . Radamel Falcao: 4 . That statistic will compound a miserable week for United who were dumped out of the FA Cup by Arsenal on Monday night. Rooney, who has been deployed in a midfield role in recent months, put his recent goal-scoring issues behind him to fire United into the lead in the 29th minute. But former United striker Danny Welbeck came back to haunt his old employers with the winner on the hour mark. Welbeck was moved on by Van Gaal following Falcao's arrival but the Colombian has not been having the best of times at Old Trafford recently. Radamel Falcao smiles from the window of his Range Rover Sport as he arrives at training on Thursday . Falcao toiled upfront against Tottenham Hotspur for Manchester United's Under 21s on Tuesday night . The failing loan signing is aware he has no long-term future at Old Trafford and will be sent back to Monaco . Falcao left Manchester United's Carrington training base on Thursday, well aware that his chances to impress at his loan club have run out. The Colombian striker suffered an embarrassing demotion to United's Under 21 side this week and sources close to Falcao say he recognises that he made the wrong move when picking Old Trafford in the summer. Spurs, meanwhile, are having no such issues up front as Kane's superb form has earned him the Barclays Premier League player of the month award for the second successive time. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney celebrates after scoring against Arsenal in the FA Cup on Monday . The Tottenham striker scored four goals in February, including a brace against north London rivals Arsenal and the equaliser against West Ham. He is also likely to earn his first senior England call-up later this month when Roy Hodgson names his squad to face Lithuania and Italy.

    Eminent psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, known to TV audiences as Dr. Phil, is on his way to Atlanta, Georgia to help the beleaguered boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina, Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively. On the eve of Bobbi Kristina’s 22nd birthday yesterday Gordon, whose social media presence had become increasingly desperate and erratic tweeted, “I’m so hurt I wanna do myself in, I know I have to strong [sic].’ In an insight into his spiraling mental state, on Tuesday he tweeted ‘You all blame me but I tried my best and it wasn’t good enough sorry. ‘ Earlier he tweeted the simple plea to Bobbi Kristina, ‘I love you soooooooo much plz wake up.’ Through it all, he has not been allowed to visit with her, as tensions between Gordon and the Brown family have escalated . On the edge: Nick Gordon was seen on outside North Fulton Hospital near Atlanta, where Bobbi Kristina was first taken after she was found unconscious face down in her bathtub . A helping hand: Dr. Phil is concerned about Nick Gordon and his on his way to offer assistance . It is five weeks since Bobbi Kristina was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub at the Roswell, Georgia, home she and Gordon, 25, shared. The only daughter of Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown has been in a medically induced coma ever since the horrific discovery just weeks from the third anniversary of her mother’s death in eerily similar circumstances. The singer was found dead in a bathtub in her hotel near Los Angeles on 11 February 2012 just hours before she was due to attend a pre Grammy awards party. But unlike Houston’s death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina’s near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 21-year-old as a criminal investigation. Two weeks after being admitted to Atlanta’s Emory Hospital Bobbi Kristina was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection. Instead she was given a tracheotomy. But any hopes that this was a sign of her condition improving were dealt a devastating blow the following week when medics attempted to bring her out of her coma only for her to suffer a series of dangerous seizures. While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Gordon, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged. It was Gordon who found Bobbi Kristina and who was administering CPR when first responders arrived on the scene. But other than this, few details have emerged. There have been reports that Bobbi Kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub. Nick and Bobbi Kristina in happier times. Gordon has been banned from seeing her by the Brown family . In addition to this she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to People. Just two weeks ago Gordon was forced to admit that police suspected drugs at the Bobbi Kristina and his Georgia home – a home owned by Houston until her death – as he gave up a legal battle to block law enforcement from obtaining CCTV footage from security cameras located at the Roswell residence. Lawyers for Gordon had tried to argue that the warrant issued on February 12 was an infringement of their client’s privacy but they subsequently dropped the case. Meanwhile the nature of Gordon and Bobbi Kristina’s union has come under intense scrutiny. Both have referred to each other as ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ in recent months but there is no evidence to support the assertion that Gordon – who was unofficially adopted into the family by Houston when he was 14 – has married the girl who he once knew as a ‘sister.’ In his most recent tweets Gordon who had previously called Bobbi Kristina his ‘wife’ refers to her as his ‘fiancée.’ What is clear is that, in the weeks leading up to the incident that has left Bobbi Kristina fighting for her life, her life had become increasingly chaotic. Just four days before she was found in the bathtub she was involved in a car wreck when she lost control of her silver Jeep Liberty and drove headlong into a gray Ford Taurus. The driver of the Ford and a passenger in her Jeep were injured and taken to hospital according to a report from police at Roswell, Georgia. Gordon too had been involved in crashes and speeding offenses in the past months. Police were also called to her home on January 23 after reports of a fight there. A security guard at the gated community where Bobbi Kristina lives told a dispatcher that one of her neighbors reported people ‘hitting each other and swinging’ outside the three-bedroom townhouse. Officers attended the scene but found no signs of an altercation. Speaking to Daily Mail Online a former boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina who remains a close friend, Zach Jafarzedeh gave an insight into the torrid pair. He said: ‘Nick has a short temper and Bobbi can be difficult. ‘It was a tug of war, because they are both very stubborn people. Bobbie is very sweet, giving and caring, but she wants all of you, everything. ‘And Nick like space, that’s where a lot of the tension between them came from.’ He revealed that Gordon was ‘getting a little wild.’ He said: ‘He was getting into car accidents. He’s been in about three or four accidents over the last couple of years. He’s got a need for speed. He’s getting these nice cars now the trust fund money is coming in [from Bobbi, sole inheritor of Whitney’s estate] and crashing them life and right. ‘He had a couple of Chevrolet Camaros. He liked fast cars, BMWs, that kind of thing. He cares, but he wasn’t slowing down.’ Against this backdrop, hostilities between Gordon and Bobbi Kristina’s father, Bobby Brown, and other family members have publicly exploded with Gordon an increasingly isolated and ostracized figure. Gordon has accused Brown of only being after his daughter’s money and he himself has been accused of that very same thing in return. Bobby Kristina’s aunt Marion ‘Pat’ Houston is the executor Whitney’s estate estimated at between $12 and $20million trust She took out a restraining order against Gordon in March citing aggressive remarks and tweets he had made and claiming that he was only interested in Bobbi Kristina because of her money. According to Pat the tweets, including one that read ‘Loam I got bigger guns than you. Watch them react to this,’ were specifically aimed at threatening her. Pat, who was one of Whitney’s managers, has made no secret of her disapproval of Bobbi Kristina and Gordon’s ‘sibling’ relationship having turned into something romantic. In increasingly erratic tweets Gordon has raged against singer Bobby Brown accusing him of being an absent father who has barely seen his daughter in the past four or five years. He has claimed that the responsibility for looking after both Whitney, who struggled with drug abuse, and Bobbi Kristina fell on his shoulders and that, now just 25, it was too great a duty to bear.

    Neil Jenkins says that Wales will be concentrated totally on winning - rather than potential mathematical permutations - when they tackle RBS 6 Nations opponents Italy at the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday. Wales, courtesy of successive victories over Scotland, France and Ireland, have put themselves firmly in the Six Nations title mix alongside England and Ireland. Although Wales' inferior points difference means they have a mountain to climb in pursuit of silverware, a possible third Six Nations crown in four years cannot be discounted. Sam Warburton (left) and George North (right) lead the celebrations after beating Ireland last week . Neil Jenkins (left) says Wales are only thinking about an Italy victory, rather than checking other results . Wales are first into action on so-called Super Saturday, with Ireland then tackling Scotland before England host France. 'The main objective and focus for us is obviously winning a Test match. If other things happen, well, so be it,' said Wales skills coach Jenkins, speaking at the team's Rome hotel on Friday. 'I am sure that we will be kicking ourselves if we didn't win and the other games went Scotland's way and France's way. 'The main objective is to win the game, and see where that takes us. 'England will know what they have to do when they play last on Saturday, but no matter what time you play, the focus is still the same for us. We have to win the game and win another Test match.' Italy's preparations have been rocked by the absence of their inspirational captain Sergio Parisse through injury, which has meant the Azzurri back-row being reshuffled and hooker Leonardo Ghiraldini taking over as skipper. 'Sergio is obviously a fantastic rugby player, a world-class number eight, and no matter what side he plays in, if he is not playing they are obviously going to miss him,' Jenkins added. 'We played them two years ago in Rome and Sergio didn't play, and they were pretty strong. Conditions weren't great that day, but it was a pretty tough Test match. 'He played pretty well against us in Cardiff last year and caused us an awful lot of problems. He is a world-class player, and any team would miss him. 'I think Italy have played some good rugby in the competition. 'It was nip and tuck with Ireland early on in that first game, and Italy probably just lacked a bit of possession. They played some good rugby against England, and then had a fantastic win in Edinburgh. 'They will probably say themselves they were disappointed with their performance last week against France. Wales, pictured this week in training, have travelled to Rome knowing a win could secure Six Nations glory . Mike Phillips passes the ball during an open session in Cardiff on Tuesday . 'But look, every time we come here it is a very tough game. Generally, we have been successful, but not by much, so we are expecting another tough game tomorrow.' Key for Wales will be to set out their stall and build points, like they did in destroying Ireland's Grand Slam dream last Saturday. 'We started incredibly well last week and ticked the scoreboard over,' Jenkins said. 'Up until Samson (Lee) got injured, which was a huge disappointment for us, it had been nigh-on perfect rugby. Territory, possession and everything we did was spot-on. 'The boys have recovered well. They know how important tomorrow is. It is an opportunity for us to go out and give ourselves a chance to try and win the championship.' Wales performed a title-winning feat in 2013 after losing their opening game - then it was against Ireland, this time England - by reeling off four successive victories and taking the championship on points difference. While this season's equation is far more complex, the desire is unchanged. 'If you look at the Six Nations, the unpredictability is what's great about the tournament,' Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny said. 'Every game is competitive, and that is why it's a huge achievement to win the Six Nations. 'All we can do is focus on our game in Rome. That's all we can do, before we wait and see what happens. 'If we go on to win it, it would give us that confidence and belief ahead of the World Cup.' Warren Gatland will be hoping to get some points on the board early on against the Italians .
Summary target: 
    Wales face Italy in final Six Nations tie at the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday .
Warren Gatland's side have chance of winning tournament .
Skills coach Neil Jenkins insists squad must focus on victory first .
England and Ireland face France and Scotland in other games .
Summarized text: 
    Wales face Italy in the RBS 6 Nations at the Stadio Olimpico on Saturday. Wales have won their last three Tests against Scotland and France - but are now firmly in contention for silverware despite their points difference a further two years 'upside' from England & Ireland, Neil Jenkins says they are only thinking about an Italian win over Scotland or France.

    Almost a dozen retiring MPs could see upwards of $130,000 per year paid out to them in their pensions, a move which could cost taxpayers $20 million in coming years. Eleven of 19 members of parliament who are retiring after Saturday's NSW election, were elected before the pension reforms in 2007 and therefore qualify for the huge payouts. Former Liberal Premier Barry O'Farrell was first elected in 1995, so he will be eligible for the pension, however former Labor Premier Nathan Rees is among the eight MPs who will miss out, The Daily Telegraph reported. Nearly a dozen retiring MPs, including former NSW Premier Barry O'Farrell have huge pensions awaiting them . Former Labor MPs Richard Amery (left) and Barry Collier (right) qualify to receive at least $130,000 a year . George Souris, Nationals MP will also be eligible for a large sum after more than a quarter of a century in parliament . Mr Rees will instead receive a standard superannuation scheme, akin to those other public servants are rewarded. The guidelines state that retiring members of parliament who have served a minimum of seven years, and were elected before 2007 are entitled to 48.8 per cent of the base parliamentary salary of $149,541. For each month past the seven year mark, that figure rises by 0.2 per cent, meaning some MPs such as Labor's former father of the house Richard Amery could see more than $150,000 a year after his 32 year service. Labor MPs Carmel Tebbutt (left) and Cherie Burton (right) will also be eligible for a large sum . Liberal MP Robyn Parker (pictured) qualifies for the hefty pension scheme . Former Premier Morris Iemma introduced the new reforms in 2007, after a report revealed the extent to which taxpayers were footing the bill. Nationals MP George Souris will also be eligible for a large sum after more than a quarter of a century in parliament, as will Labor MPs Carmel Tebbutt and Cherie Burton. Other candidates from the Labor camp include Barry Collier and Barbara Perry. Liberal MP Robyn Parker qualifies for the hefty pension scheme, as does Nationals' Andrew Stoner and Don Page, and Independent Chris Hartcher. Independent Chris Hartcher is eligible for the scheme, which was changed in 2007 to make it more modest . Former NSW deputy Premier Andrew Stoner (left) can look forward to a profitable pension, as can fellow Nationals MP Don Page (right) Between these 11 MPs the bill taxpayers may have to foot could reach $20 million over coming decades, taking into account the average life expectancy of Australians. However the scheme has been heavily criticised by Greens upper house member John Kaye, who described it as 'excessively generous'. 'The old scheme was excessively generous and most people would look at it and question where the fairness is', Mr Kaye told The Daily Telegraph. He added that some MPs eligible for the old scheme 'clearly don't need it', and asked them to watch how they spend their cash. The scheme, for which Labor MP Barbara Perry is eligible for, has been heavily criticised by Greens upper house member John Kaye .

    Eleven of 19 retiring NSW MPs could see pensions of at least $130,000 .

    A sheep and cattle grazier is using her 32,000 hectare farm to help drought-stricken farmers get fit. Instead of using traditional equipment, Joy McClymont uses things lying around her 32,000-hectare farm to train her clients by using irrigation pipes as weights, swing truck springs in place of kettle bells, tyres to do push ups and the dam to run laps around. Then passes on her tips and tricks to her fitness program clients. Mother-of-four Joy McClymont lives out in Queensland's central west and started Off The Track Training . This is helping producers in Ms McClymont's region get their minds of the crippling drought which has gripped more than 70 per cent of Queensland. The former triathlete, who lives 100km from Longreach in the state's central west, told Woman's Day three-quarters of her clients were suffering from the dry conditions. She said the process of getting and keeping fit had been therapeutic. 'I tell them [my clients] their fitness is the one thing they can actually control and exercise will change the way they face the day. It tricks you - you feel like you're 10 kilograms lighter and bulletproof,' Ms McClymont said. 'For me, this has been sanity saving.' She wanted her clients to use equipment they already had their farm with spending a huge amount of money . This includes moon rocks as medicine balls (above) and irrigation pipes as weights . Ms McClymont used to be a competitive triathlon and qualified for an ironwoman competition . Ms McClymont said the idea of starting an outback fitness program that people could access online came after the birth of her first child with her husband, Paul. She now has four children aged from one to six years old. The former ironwoman qualifier found it was extremely difficult for her to get back on the horse after her pregnancy because of the remoteness of her home. 'I just wanted to do something to make it easier for people to look after their health and do something for themselves in tough times, especially when there's a drought,' Ms McClymont told Daily Mail Australia. 'It also makes it easier for them to manage their stress when their health is better.' That's when she started up Off The Track Training, which gives people living in rural areas access to all the benefits of a metropolitan personal trainer. Ms McClymont and her group of trained professionals provides tailored training programs, meal plans and nutritional advice to clients from the Northern Territory, South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. They also get face-to-face time with Ms McClymont and her team when required as well as contact through Facebook or the phone. These programs can last from 50 days to 100 days depending on her clients' needs. She said this communication helped build a support network for those who are drought-stricken. 'When you live on a property, so much of your identity is tied to the place. When it doesn't perform well, people often have nothing else in their lives.' Ms McClymont recommends exercising outside to utilise the landscape and get fresh air into the body . This man is doing squats with a metal beam, which could be found on a farming property . Ms McClymont is helping those living in remote and rural areas to get their minds off the Queensland drought . Currently, more than 70 per cent of Queensland is suffering drought conditions and have been doing so for three years . Ms McClymont told Daily Mail Australia said she did not wanting her clients to spend more money on equipment they would not use. 'The idea is to get them to exercise on their property,' she said. 'I want them to use what they have, so they can be seriously sustainable and they're not spending buckets of money to exercise. 'People buy my programs but they buy the connection, the network... That is what is needed mostly, they need support to get them there.' Tyres are also a good way to exercise. Ms McClymont recommends running over them and using to do push ups . Ms McClymont also uses her 20-kilometre driveway as a running or cycling track to keep fit . She said her best pieces of gym equipment were an irrigation pipe, round moon rocks and a crowbar. Being out on a remote property, Ms McClymont has had to get creative with how she keeps fit. She uses her 20-kilometre as a cycling track, does sprint exercises on her airstrip and her dam to do laps. The mother also tries to incorporate training into her day-to-day activities. During mustering season, Ms McClymont opts to run from one gate to another instead of driving her ute. She said her best pieces of gym equipment were an irrigation pipe, round moon rocks and a crowbar.

    Manchester United have been linked with summer moves for both Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo. But who would you buy if you could only pick one? We asked our experts... Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo have both been linked with a move to Manchester United . MARTIN KEOWN - Ronaldo . Bale is a better long-term investment but if you’re talking about a transfer this summer that would make an immediate impact, then it has to be Ronaldo. United have gone from dominating at the top to fighting for fourth. Signing Ronaldo would bring United instant success and put them back on the map. He understands the club and would appreciate the enormity of the task, but he more than anyone else would breathe new life into the fans. What a statement that would be. Ronaldo enjoyed six successful years under Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford . NEIL ASHTON - Ronaldo . This feels like a trick question. Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are two of the greatest players we have ever had the privilege to watch. Ronaldo has done it all before at United - and we would love to see him do it all over again. Ronaldo trains ahead of El Clasico against Barcelona in La Liga on Sunday night . ROB DRAPER - Ronaldo . There’s no real debate. No disrespect to Bale, but the all-round game of Ronaldo, from his range of skill, shooting, free-kicks, finishing, heading is just better. That doesn’t make Bale a bad player - just not as good. In financial terms you could make a case for Bale being five years younger but I’m pretty sure you could rely on four good years out of Ronaldo. Ronaldo celebrates after scoring in the Champions League tie against Schalke earlier this month . JOE BERNSTEIN - Bale . It is purely an age thing. Ronaldo is unlikely to be as good in the next three years as he has been in the last three years and as his body language showed last weekend, you wouldn’t want him around if he feared he was in decline. Bale’s game is tailor-made for the Premier League and if his pace was added to the current United technicians they would be champions . Bale trains at the Valdebebas training ground before heading to Barcelona for the crunch clash . RIATH AL SAMARRAI - Bale . No doubting Ronaldo is the better player but Bale has age on his side and is not so unbelievably selfish as a person that he would pout if a team-mate scores. PETE JENSON - Bale . Gareth Bale, no question. The former Spurs man is only going to get better. Cristiano Ronaldo has peaked. Bale would make a sensational return to the Premier League if he joins Manchester United .
Summary target: 
    Manchester United have been linked with a move for Gareth Bale .
They would also be interested in re-signing Cristiano Ronaldo .

    Jenson Button is convinced ailing McLaren will one day challenge the might of Mercedes despite the two teams currently at opposite ends of the pace spectrum at present. McLaren and new power-unit supplier Honda suffered abject humiliation in the season-opening grand prix in Australia earlier this month. The team were already without the services of big-name acquisition Fernando Alonso after the Spaniard sustained concussion in a testing accident in Barcelona. Come the race, reserve Kevin Magnussen failed to even make it to the start line due to a power-unit issue that forced the young Dane to pull over on the formation lap. Jenson Button waves to the crowd before the first race of the season in Australia . McLaren were well of the pace in Melbourne... Button finished 11th, two laps behind winner Lewis Hamilton . At least Button saw the chequered flag, describing it at the time as 'a small victory', albeit finishing two laps down on race-winner Lewis Hamilton in 11th and last place. Despite McLaren's seemingly hopeless position heading into Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix, a positive Button can see hope on the horizon. 'We're a hell of a long way behind, but I feel we have something we can mould into something very special in the future, which is very exciting,' said Button. 'Being 1.5 seconds off the pace and knowing you've peaked with your package, that's got to hurt. 'Whereas at least we have a glimmer of hope we can possibly challenge Mercedes one day.' Asked as to the reasoning behind his belief, Button replied: 'The direction with the car in terms of aerodynamics, but also with how aggressive this engine is, which is why we're having so many issues. 'In many ways - it's probably wrong for me to say - it's probably more like a Mercedes than it is the other two manufacturers (Ferrari and Renault) in terms of design, aggressiveness and packaging. Lewis Hamilton sprays champagne from the podium after winning the season-opening Australian Grand Prix . Hamilton led team-mate Nico Rosberg home in Melbourne as Mercedes dominated the opening race of 2015 . 'It's just going to take a little bit of time, but if we didn't have that hope you wouldn't see the strong effort by the whole team. 'They're not heading to races because they're paid to, they're doing so because they're passionate about racing. They're looking forward to the future as much as I am.' The one bonus for McLaren this weekend is Alonso is poised to return, pending a final medical check by the FIA at the Sepang International Circuit on Thursday. Racing director Eric Boullier, for one, is happy to have the Spaniard back on board as he said: 'I'm pleased to see Fernando back in the car. 'He's raring to go, and I know he's been working hard behind the scenes to prepare himself for this weekend.' Fernando Alonso is poised to return to the McLaren cockpit providing he passes an FIA medical on Thursday .

    Diagnosed with breast cancer, Sara Cutting faced the prospect of losing her curly blonde hair during the rigours of chemotherapy. But rather than let it get to her, she decided to embrace baldness by taking a selfie every day – and showing off a spectacular hat each time. The 46-year-old company director makes her own headwear from anything she can get her hands on, including cakes, board games, a teapot, radio, lampshade and even kitchen roll. Have your cake and eat it: Is it a hat? is it a snack? or could it even be both.  Sara Cutting has embraced her baldness by taking a selfie each day . Perky: Fancy a brew anyone?

She then uploads smiling selfies to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, where she has thousands of followers. And to cap it all, the idea has helped raise £9,000 for MacMillan Cancer Support. Now on day 142 of the challenge, her treatment has finished and her hair is starting to grow back – but she has decided that she likes being bald and plans to stay that way. ‘Life has to go on and you have to find a way of coping, so this has been a really good focus for me,’ she said. ‘It’s a reason for me to get my make up on, get dressed and put on a big smile, no matter how I’m feeling.’ Miss Cutting, who runs a building and renovation company in Brighton, said the experience has been ‘liberating’. Her selfies have generated many fans online, with offers of ideas coming in from as far as Australia. And she has already worn hats by designer Philip Treacy, who was behind many of the creations worn at the Royal Wedding in 2011. Miss Cutting, who was diagnosed with cancer last summer and began chemotherapy in October, begins a four-week course of radiotherapy next week. She hopes her challenge will help raise awareness and prompt others to check for signs of the disease. Donations can be made on Sara's JustGiving page.

    Undergoing oxygen treatment in a pressure chamber, this is a survivor of the deadly explosion at a Ukrainian coal mine that killed 33 people. Andrei Serebrennikov, who was exposed to dangerous levels of methane, is being treated at the Regional Hospital of Occupational Diseases in Donetsk after the incident on Wednesday. The last missing miner was found dead tonight, following the blast that happened before dawn more than 3,200ft underground at the Zasyadko mine in the city. Scroll down for video . Oxygen treatment: Andrei Serebrennikov (left) was exposed to dangerous levels of methane in the explosion . Medical help: He is being treated at the Regional Hospital of Occupational Diseases in Donetsk after the blast . Assistance: Mr Serebrennikov is undergoing an enriched oxygen treatment in a pressure chamber in Ukraine . Severe injuries: Doctors operate on another miner who survived the explosion but suffered extensive burns . It is the largest city held by the separatist rebels who have been fighting Ukrainian forces since April. Rebel officials said the accident was caused by methane gas. Zasyadko mine has a history of deadly accidents, including one in November 2007 that killed 101 workers, and two more the following month that killed a total of 57. Although the latest gas explosion was not directly caused by the fighting, miners say war may have contributed to the death toll. Other parts of the mine had been damaged in the past by artillery strikes, which cut off access routes and may have made escape more difficult for those trapped below ground. Band of brothers: Ukrainian coal miners carry the body of a colleague killed in the explosion on Wednesday . Elevator: The miners board a lift going underground to help search for colleagues and clear up debris . Response: A Ukrainian mining rescuer holds a stretcher after taking part in the search for bodies of miners . Another survivor, Ivan Lazarenko, lay in hospital yesterday - still unconscious and in bandages. If he recovers, it would be the second time this year he had escaped death at the mine. He was trapped once in a lift when the mine was hit by incoming fire, his wife Tatyana Kosenko said. She added: ‘I was getting ready for work and they called me to tell me he was in the burn centre, but was alive and well. Somehow this is considered to be “well”. Of course, thank God, he's alive.’ Were it not for the war between Russia-backed separatists and the Ukrainian authorities, Eduard Kiporov, one of those missing and presumed dead in the blast, would not have been working at all at Zasyadko. Miners: The blast happened before dawn more than 3,000 feet underground at the Zasyadko mine . Shock: A Ukrainian coal miner looks out from the cabin of a truck loaded with seven of his colleagues' bodies . Underground work: An Ukrainian mining rescuer boards a bus after taking part in the search for bodies . He took the job only because the mine where he normally worked, Oktyabrskaya, was bombed several months ago. ‘They constantly shot at this mine. They went into that mine every day and had no idea whether they would come back out or not, either from artillery fire or some accident,’ said his sister Julia. The area near the Zasyadko is littered with the debris of missiles, a short distance from the graveyard where victims of previous disasters are buried and where fresh graves had been dug for those killed in Wednesday's blast. Last July, a bus carrying miners to work in Krasnopartizan in Luhansk Province was struck by fire from Grad rockets killing four people and injuring 16 miners. A Ukrainian soldier has been killed and another wounded fighting pro-Russian separatists in the east, military officials said yesterday. It came as Kiev accused rebels of increasing violations of a ceasefire deal, which President Petro Poroshenko has described as the last chance for peace with the pro-Russian rebels. Meanwhile haunting photographs showed 23 Ukrainian soldier's bodies being transferred back from pro-Russian rebels to Ukraine. Another loss: A coffin sits discarded and leaning up against a fence behind a morgue in Donetsk, Ukraine . Moving: Volunteers reclaim 23 Ukrainian soldier's bodies from pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk yesterday . Accusations of continued violence on both sides show the fragility of the peace accord agreed in Minsk last month, which calls for the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the frontline. Some 6,000 people have been killed in fighting since separatists took up arms last year in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, in response to the overthrow of the Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich in Kiev. Interior Ministry adviser Zoryan Shkiryak said the rebels were not failing to  pull back, and also building up forces in southern Donetsk, near the Ukrainian-held port city of Mariupol. He said: ‘They are not withdrawing arms, they are not observing the ceasefire, they continue to relocate units and increase their number of tanks and rocket launchers.’ The military said rebels had attacked Ukrainian troop positions or civilian targets 40 times in 24 hours, including 17 artillery attacks. The rebels accuse Ukrainian forces almost daily of firing. Grim task: Workers and Red Cross members load bodies of Ukrainian soldiers near the Donetsk city morgue .

Greeting: Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin (right) welcomes his British counterpart Philip Hammond (left) in Kiev yesterday. Ukraine's army will be trained by foreign advisers . The conflict has plunged ties between Russia and the West to Cold War-era lows as Kiev, along with the United States and the European Union, say they have evidence that Moscow is arming the rebels and boosting their ranks with regular army soldiers. Russia has repeatedly denied the accusations and accused the United States of pushing Kiev's pro-Western government into conflict with its own people. Ukraine's army, which has gained experience in fighting with separatists, will also be trained by foreign advisers. ‘We will provide military trainers to the Ukrainian Armed Forces,’ Britain’s Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told journalists after his meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart in Kiev.

    'Poor': Sergei Pugachev, who was once branded 'Putin's banker', said the order has made it difficult for he and his partner, Alexandra Tolstoy, pictured together, to support their home . A Russian tycoon exiled in London who is fighting a freeze on his £1.3billion in assets by the High Court has claimed he is now a 'poor man' who cannot afford to support his family. Sergei Pugachev, who was once branded 'Putin's banker', said the order has made it difficult for him and his partner, Alexandra Tolstoy, to support their home. Last year it was reported the couple, who have three children and own a £12million house, employ two housekeepers, three nannies, two drivers and a live-in doctor. And Ms Tolstoy, 41, said it was hard to live on the £10,000-a-week allowed by the court. Mr Pugachev, the former billionaire business partner of the Queen's nephew Viscount Linley is accused in Moscow of siphoning more than £655million in funds from Mezhprombank, which filed for insolvency in 2010, including $700 million in Russian Central Bank bailout money. The 52-year-old former tycoon, who denies any wrongdoing, complained the freeze has left him unable to support Tolstoy who said last year it was hard to live on the £10,000 a week allowed by the court. 'I can be called a poor man. I do not have money to support my family and my property, and this is more important than paying the lawyers,' he told Vedomosti newspaper in Moscow, blaming the arrest of his bank accounts and assets. He said he has borrowed $5 million towards his $10 million legal bill, but was now unable to take more loans because his assets were frozen. As a result, he has dispensed with his lawyers. Last year, his  socialite partner - a distant relative of Leo Tolstoy - said 'we are just surviving' on the £10,000 a week allowance. The Deposit Insurance Agency in Moscow, which is taking the legal action, claim the 'statements of his partner Alexandra Tolstoy' about their lifestyle belie 'his declarations about financial difficulties'. A source claimed his move to dispense with his British lawyers 'looks like a tactical trick and is aimed at making obstacles for English justice'. Last week a London Court of Appeal judge ruled that Pugachev, also previously nicknamed 'cashier to the Kremlin', must disclose further information about trusts he uses to bolster his income. Lavish: Last year it was reported the couple, pictured together, who have three children and own a £12million house, employ two housekeepers, three nannies, two drivers and a live-in doctor . 'Sophisticated and wily operators should not be able to make themselves immune to the courts' orders,' said the judge. Pugachev claims he is the victim of a 'politically motivated' asset grab by figures in the Russan elite of which he was a member before fleeing to London. His property was 'expropriated by the state and by private persons', and sold at rock bottom prices, he claimed. He also alleged in court that a senior Deposit Insurance Agency official earlier made 'a brazen attempt to extort money' from him, and threatened that 'he or his family could be physically harmed'. In November, Interpol put Pugachev on its wanted list at Russia's request, with Putin's spokesman alleging: 'He built up huge amounts of debts and then ran away.' Struggle: Ms Tolstoy, pictured, said 'she and her husband are just surviving' on the £10,000 a week allowance . Faced by the legal moves in Moscow, Pugachev in October blasted Putin, claiming all Russian businessmen are now 'serfs' under his total control. 'Today in Russia there is no private property. There are only serfs who belong to Putin,' he told the Financial Times, in a blunt warning over the collapse of regulated capitalism in his homeland. 'Now there is Putin and there are his lieutenants who carry out his orders - and all cash generated is put on the balance of Putin,' he alleged. 'The country is in a state of war. And therefore big business cannot live as before. It has to live under military rules.' He alleged: 'If Putin says he wants to buy something, you cannot say that you do not want to sell. 'If he says 'I want to buy something' then you say, 'Thanks for saying you want to buy it, and not just taking it.'

    A recent survey has revealed that more than a third of Brits take four or fewer baths a year — preferring instead to opt for the convenience of a shower. More fool them, I say. I’m part of the Tom Ford school of thinking — the fashion designer has been reported to take up to five baths a day, revering them for their ‘meditative’ properties. And he’s right. When it comes to relaxation, nothing beats a long, hot soak. These days, you can make your bath even more self-indulgent with gadgets that let you lounge in the tub while watching films, reading books or listening to music. And some of them will even run the water for you. I slipped beneath the suds to try them out . . . RELAX INTO PILLOW PERFECTION . The Savoy Bath Pillow . Lounge in utmost comfort with a bath pillow from one of the world’s swankiest hotels — The Savoy Bath Pillow (£15, Savoy Tea Shop). While a night at The Savoy will cost you the best part of £400, one of their bath pillows — described to me by one travel editor as ‘the best I’ve found anywhere, ever’ — can be yours for a fraction of the cost. Unlike its cheaper cousins, this luxurious pillow is not inflatable or square. Instead, it’s a foam cylinder, covered in spa-style waffle cotton, which can be removed for washing. Two suction cups on a flap of fabric hold it firmly against the bath, and the cylinder sits at the nape of your neck, cradling you gently as you drift off. Pure bathing bliss. KEEP A GLASS OF WINE SAFE . Bosign Suction Wine Glass Holder . Relaxing with a glass of red by candlelight sounds like a dream — until you knock it onto the floor or into the bath. To avoid such mishaps, look for holders, such as the Bosign Suction Wine Glass Holder (£6.95, homearama.co.uk), a sleek, stainless-steel design that works best on a perpendicular bath side. They also do a tealight holder (£6.45). For an all-in-one solution that will hold not only a glass of wine and a candle, but also a book, check out the Bathroom Bath Tub Caddy with Wine, Candle and Book Holder (£14.99, amazon.co.uk). It may look a little twee, but it does the job so well, you’re unlikely to care. Extending handles mean that it will fit over any bath up to 90 cm wide (a standard bath is 70 cm) and the candle holder, book stand and wine glass holders are all detachable. LIGHT UP YOUR LATHER . Colour Changing Spa Lights . If candles don’t light your fire, there’s a wealth of other lighting options to try out at bathtime. Colour Changing Spa Lights (£6.95, prezzybox.com) are fully submersible and come with a suction cup, which means they can stick to the sides and the base of the bath. They change colour gradually and will even float on the surface. For a real Saturday Night Fever effect, try the Underwater Disco Lightshow (£7.99, firebox.com), a floating gadget that projects multicoloured patterns of light around your bathroom — rather like a watery mirrorball. It sounds bonkers but, with the lights off, it’s truly mesmerising. HAVE A RAVE WHILE YOU BATHE . The Mini Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker . If you enjoy being lulled by Handel’s Water Music while you bathe, then a waterproof speaker is a must. The best solution is a Bluetooth speaker that connects wirelessly to your computer, tablet or smartphone, meaning your pricey gadgets can stay safe and dry outside the bathroom, while you listen to your music inside. The Mini Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker (£6.15, amazon.co.uk) has a suction cup attached, so you can stick it to tiles. It doesn’t offer the best quality sound — what do you expect at that price? — and for best results, you need to turn the volume right up on the source device, then adjust on the speaker. But it’s rechargeable and does everything that you need it to, including skipping tracks. You can even use it to answer your phone. That is if you don’t mind your bath being disturbed. For a better sound experience, though at a significantly elevated price, try the rechargeable waterproof Ultimate Ears Megaboom Speaker (£249.95, amazon.co.uk). Only about the size of two stacked tin cans, it produces seriously impressive sound. And if you really love your music, you might consider an upgrade to the Kaldewei Soundwave Sound System (£396.25, ukbathrooms.com), which turns your whole bath into a speaker that wirelessly connects to the music source using Bluetooth. The sounds aren’t just audible, they can actually be felt as vibrations through the water — fine if you’re listening to waves or whales, though less relaxing if you have a penchant for heavy metal! WATERPROOF YOUR IPAD . LifeProof’s nuud iPad case . Back in the old days, reading a book or magazine in the bath was the ultimate escape — until, of course, you dropped it in the water and had to leave it splayed on a radiator to dry. Now that an estimated two in five of us own a tablet or eReader, the ramifications of dropping your novel in the bath have become a little more significant. So, although the Kobo Aura H2O eReader (£139.95, johnlewis.com) is £60 more than the basic model and around £80 more than the cheapest Kindle, it might be a worthwhile investment, because it’s waterproof for up to 30 minutes. If you’d rather watch television in the bath, you could either splash out on a Hafele Waterproof TV (from £470, hafele.co.uk) or invest in a waterproof case and stream films or TV through your tablet. LifeProof’s nuud iPad case (£89.95, apple.com) does the job, but comes at a price. If you’re just planning on leaving your device on the side, then a water-resistant one (which is splash-proof, but not submersible), such as the Griffin Survivor Case (from £19.99, amazon.co.uk), which comes with its own stand, will do. An even cheaper option is a Go Travel Waterproof Case (from £5.09, amazon.co.uk) — effectively a heavy-duty plastic bag, which uses a Velcro closure to keep the water away from your gadget if it accidentally gets dunked. ... AND THE BATH CAN EVEN RUN ITSELF! Crosswater Digital . If you dream of having a butler to draw a bath for you, then this gadget could make all of your Downton Abbey fantasies come true. Crosswater Digital (from £499, crosswater.co.uk) is a seriously high-tech bath system that lets you take control of your bath or shower from an app on your smartphone. You can dial in the temperature and depth you want — and even store up to three presets, just in case you prefer a hotter or deeper bath than your partner. You’ll need to be on the same wifi network (so you can’t start running the bath when you’re on the train on the way home), but it can be used from anywhere in the house. And if you’ve got the additional electronic plug system, you can even drain the bath using the app, too. Unfortunately, the one thing it won’t do is to clean the bath for you!
